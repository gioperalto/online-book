## The Core Theme: The Physics of the Lie
The setting is 1988 Detroit. The American auto industry is struggling, the city is rusting, and the streets are slick with rain and oil.
The central premise relies on Mechanical Forensics. When a crime is staged to look like an accident, the laws of physics are often the only witness that cannot be bribed. The mystery is solved not by finding a fingerprint on a gun, but by measuring skid marks, analyzing the crush depth of a bumper, and examining the filaments of shattered headlights.
It is a "Fair Play" mystery: the reader is given the exact same measurements and mechanical facts as the protagonist.

## The Protagonist: Calvin Hoke
**Role**: Senior Claims Investigator for Great Lakes Mutual Insurance.
Appearance:
* The Look: Calvin is 55, heavy-set, and looks more like a high school geography teacher than a detective. He wears a tan raincoat that has seen better days, thick bifocals, and carries a clipboard everywhere.
* The Tools: He doesn't carry a gun. His holster contains a heavy-duty steel tape measure, a tire tread depth gauge, and a magnifying glass.
* Distinctive Feature: He walks with a cane due to a "bad hip" (a result of a crash years ago). This forces him to move slowly and methodically, observing things the younger, faster police officers walk right past.
Motivations:
* The Bottom Line: On paper, his job is to save the insurance company money by denying fraudulent claims.
* The Mathematical Truth: In reality, Calvin is offended by chaos. He believes that every chaotic event—a crash, a fall, a fire—can be rewound to a single, logical starting point using math. He hates "accidents" because he believes there is no such thing; there is only negligence or intent.

## Immediate Relevant Characters
1. **Vera DeMarco (The Expert)**
* **Role**: Owner of DeMarco’s Salvage & Repair.
* **Relation to Calvin**: His sounding board and mechanical expert.
* **Appearance**: A woman in her 30s, always covered in grease, wearing blue coveralls with her name stitched in red. She has a harsh, smoker’s laugh and hands rougher than sandpaper.
* **Function**: Calvin understands the physics; Vera understands the machines. When Calvin needs to know if a brake line was cut or if it rusted through naturally, he takes the wreckage to Vera. She provides the tangible mechanical evidence the reader can follow.
2. **Detective Frank Miller (The Rubber Stamper)**
* **Role**: Detroit Traffic Division.
* **Relation to Calvin**: Friendly antagonist.
* **Appearance**: Thin, tired, constantly looking at his watch.
* **Function**: Miller just wants to clear the scene and open the road. He is quick to rule things "accidental" to close files. He represents the system Calvin has to fight against—the desire for an easy answer over the correct one.

## The Inciting Incident
A union boss, deeply involved in contract negotiations, is found dead in his car at the bottom of a ravine. The roads were icy, and there is a guardrail smashed through. Police rule it a tragic DUI (Drunk Driving) accident, citing an empty whiskey bottle in the passenger seat.
The Clue (Layman Deducible):
Calvin arrives to assess the payout for the life insurance policy. He examines the wreckage.
* **Observation**: The car hit a concrete abutment before rolling down the hill. The driver's side airbag deployed.
* **The Deduction**: Calvin looks at the steering wheel. The airbag is deflated, but there is no "face powder" (friction burn or makeup transfer) on the bag, and the driver’s glasses—found on his face—are unbroken.
* **The Conclusion**: If the driver had been alive and sitting in the seat during the impact, his face would have hit the bag with tremendous force. The fact that his face is unbruised and glasses intact proves he was already dead (or slumped over elsewhere) when the car went off the road. The crash was staged.

## The Antagonist: "The Adjuster"
**Identity**: Unknown

**Methodology**:
The killer is a professional "cleaner" who specializes in Mechanical Staging. They don't use exotic poisons or silencers. They use gravity, friction, and leverage. They loosen a lug nut just enough so the wheel flies off five miles down the highway. They replace a high-pressure fuse with a low-pressure one so a house fire looks electrical.
The Mystery:
The killer knows insurance protocols as well as Calvin does. They are essentially playing a game of chess with insurance policies. The killer is creating "perfect accidents" that satisfy the police report requirements (skid marks, broken glass, weather conditions) but leave tiny mathematical errors that only a claims adjuster would notice.

Sample "Deducible" Clue for the Reader
Later in the book, Calvin investigates a hit-and-run. A witness claims a blue sedan was speeding, slammed on the brakes, and skidded into the victim.
* Calvin's Finding: He measures the skid marks. They are perfectly straight and even.
* The Layman Deduction: Most cars in 1988 did not have Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS). If a driver panics and slams the brakes, the wheels lock. Because roads are crowned (curved for drainage) or uneven, a car with locked wheels will almost always drift or rotate slightly to the low side of the road.
* The Reveal: Perfectly straight skid marks suggest the car was being towed or pushed in neutral, or the marks were painted on. The car didn't brake; the scene was manufactured.
