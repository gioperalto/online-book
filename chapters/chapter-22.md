# The Sins of the Father

The sentencing hearing for Diana Ashworth was scheduled for three weeks after the verdict. I spent most of that time in a state of suspended animation—attending to the mountain of paperwork that had accumulated during the trial, fielding calls from reporters who wanted exclusive interviews, and avoiding Sarah's increasingly frequent attempts to reach me.

But it was Patricia Webb who consumed my thoughts.

Marcus Webb's cousin. A woman who had appeared out of nowhere, visited David Sterling in prison under a false name, and then vanished like smoke. The facial recognition match to her 1998 booking photo was compelling but not conclusive—twenty-five years could change a face dramatically, and the image quality from the prison visitor logs was grainy at best.

Margaret had her people searching, but Patricia Webb had learned from Eleanor's network how to disappear. No credit card activity, no cell phone pings, no traffic camera hits. Whoever had trained her to stay hidden had trained her well.

"She's still in Millbrook," I said to Margaret over coffee at the hospital cafeteria. Rosa Martinez had been moved to a long-term care facility, but I'd gotten into the habit of visiting the hospital anyway—the coffee was terrible, but the anonymity was worth it. "She didn't drive all the way here just to turn Sterling and leave."

"Agreed." Margaret stirred her coffee without drinking it. "The question is why she surfaced now. She's been invisible for twenty-five years. What brought her back?"

"Eleanor's death."

"Maybe. But she could have stayed hidden. The network is collapsing—most of Eleanor's old contacts are either in custody or running for cover. Coming out of hiding now is a risk. Unless..."

"Unless she has unfinished business."

Margaret's phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, and something shifted in her expression—a tightening around the eyes that I'd learned to recognize as concern.

"What?"

"Julian's trial was supposed to start next Monday." She turned the phone toward me. "His lawyers just filed a motion to dismiss. They're claiming prosecutorial misconduct."

---

The motion was a masterwork of legal misdirection.

Julian's defense team—a group of expensive attorneys his trust fund had purchased the moment he turned twenty-one—argued that the prosecution had improperly obtained Julian's confession, that the circumstances of his arrest were tainted by my conflict of interest, and that the physical evidence connecting him to the strangulation had been collected in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

Most of it was nonsense. Julian had confessed voluntarily, without coercion, after being properly Mirandized. The evidence had been collected with proper warrants. But buried in the fifty-page filing was a single paragraph that made my blood run cold.

"Detective James Marlowe's familial connection to the victims of Eleanor Ashworth's alleged criminal enterprise constitutes a fundamental conflict of interest that pervades every aspect of this investigation. Evidence gathered by Detective Marlowe, including but not limited to the defendant's confession, physical evidence from the scene, and witness statements, must be considered inherently unreliable and should be excluded in its entirety."

They weren't just attacking my testimony. They were trying to invalidate every piece of evidence I'd touched.

If they succeeded, Julian would walk. Sterling's recantation would stand unchallenged. And the entire case—not just against Julian, but against the remaining network members—would begin to crumble.

I found DA Kwan in her office, surrounded by law books and empty coffee cups.

"Tell me this won't work."

She looked up from the motion, her eyes ringed with exhaustion. "It shouldn't work. The conflict of interest argument is weak—you weren't assigned to investigate Eleanor Ashworth, you were assigned to investigate her murder. Your family history with the victim is unusual but not automatically disqualifying."

"But?"

"But the judge who handles Julian's case isn't Katherine Mills. She recused herself because her nephew once worked at Ashworth Shipping." Kwan set down her reading glasses. "The replacement is Judge Marcus Thompson. Federal appointee, fifteen years on the bench, reputation for being a stickler about procedural issues."

"Is he clean?"

"As far as we know. He's not in Morrison's files or Sterling's testimony or any of the network records we've recovered." She paused. "But that doesn't mean he's sympathetic to our case. Thompson believes in the letter of the law. If the defense can show even minor procedural irregularities..."

"He'll suppress the evidence."

"He'll at least consider it. And if he grants the motion to dismiss..."

She didn't need to finish the sentence. If Julian walked on a technicality, the defense teams for every other network member would file identical motions. My conflict of interest would become the crack that shattered the entire prosecution.

BUT that night, Patricia Webb came to me.

I was in my kitchen, nursing a bourbon I didn't really want, when I heard the back door creak. My hand went to my service weapon—a reflex so ingrained I didn't even think about it—but before I could draw, a voice cut through the darkness.

"I wouldn't, Detective. I'm not here to hurt you."

She stepped into the light from the window, and I saw her clearly for the first time. Older than her booking photo, obviously—the sharp features had softened slightly, and silver threads wove through the auburn hair—but unmistakably the same woman who'd visited Sterling in prison.

"Patricia Webb."

"Patricia Williams, actually. I haven't been a Webb in a very long time." She held her hands where I could see them, palms out. "May I sit?"

"Why would I let a woman who's been sabotaging my investigation sit in my kitchen?"

"Because I'm not sabotaging your investigation. I'm trying to save it." She gestured toward the chair across from me. "Five minutes, Detective. That's all I'm asking. After that, you can arrest me, shoot me, or throw me out. Your choice."

I kept my hand near my weapon but nodded toward the chair. She sat with the careful grace of someone who'd learned to minimize sudden movements.

"Talk."

"I was Eleanor Ashworth's niece. Did you know that?" She watched my face, reading my reaction. "Not by blood—by marriage. My mother was Eleanor's younger sister. She died when I was twelve."

"I didn't know Eleanor had a sister."

"She didn't, officially. Margaret—my mother—was the family embarrassment. She married a Webb, of all things. A cousin of Marcus Webb, which made her practically a traitor in Eleanor's eyes." Patricia's voice carried old bitterness, old grief. "When Mother died, Eleanor could have taken me in. Instead, she had me placed in foster care and erased my mother's existence from the family records."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you need to understand that I have every reason to want Eleanor and her legacy destroyed. I've spent twenty-five years gathering evidence, building connections, waiting for the right moment." She leaned forward. "When Sterling first went to prison, I saw an opportunity. He knew things—things even Catherine Webb's investigation hadn't uncovered. I offered him a trade: information about the network's remaining assets in exchange for testimony that would ensure convictions."

"You turned him."

"I tried to. But someone got to him first—someone who offered him something more valuable than information." Her eyes met mine. "Detective, Sterling didn't recant because he was coerced or because his deal was finalized. He recanted because he was told that if he cooperated with the prosecution, his daughter would be killed."

The words hung in the air between us. Sterling had a daughter—I'd seen her mentioned in his file, a thirty-year-old accountant living in Boston. I'd assumed she was just another detail, irrelevant to the case.

"Who made the threat?"

"That's what I'm trying to find out. Someone inside the network is still operating—someone who wasn't in Morrison's files or Sterling's original confession. Someone Eleanor kept completely separate from the rest of her operations." Patricia pulled a folded photograph from her coat pocket and slid it across the table. "I took this yesterday, outside Sterling's daughter's apartment building."

The photograph showed a man—average height, average build, the kind of face that could disappear into any crowd. He was standing on a street corner, apparently reading a newspaper, but his eyes were fixed on a building entrance just visible at the edge of the frame.

"Who is he?"

"I don't know. But he's been following her for a week, and he wasn't there before Sterling recanted." Patricia's voice was steady, but I could hear the fear beneath it. "Detective, the adjuster was captured. Morrison and Caldwell are in custody. Harper is awaiting trial. But someone is still out there—someone who has the resources and the will to threaten a witness's family. Someone who wants Julian Ashworth to walk free badly enough to risk exposure."

"Why Julian? Diana's already convicted. Sterling's facing murder charges. What does Julian's freedom gain them?"

"That's what I've been trying to determine." Patricia stood, moving toward the door. "Julian Ashworth is the only heir who isn't facing conviction. If he walks, the Ashworth estate passes to him. And whoever controls Julian controls the family fortune—along with whatever secrets are still hidden inside those walls."

She paused at the threshold, silhouetted against the night.

"I'm not your enemy, Detective. We want the same thing. But there are forces at work here that neither of us fully understands." She glanced back over her shoulder. "Find out who's protecting Julian. Find out why. Before they decide you're too dangerous to leave alive."

Then she was gone, dissolving into the shadows of my backyard like she'd never been there at all.

---

THEREFORE I spent the next morning digging into Julian Ashworth's defense team.

The lead attorney was Geoffrey Crane—a name that sounded vaguely familiar but that I couldn't place. Harvard Law, like Malcolm Price. Twenty years of practice, primarily in corporate litigation. No obvious connection to the Ashworth family or Eleanor's network.

But his junior associate was a different story.

Thomas Reid, thirty-two years old, three years out of law school. His credentials were impeccable—Yale undergraduate, Columbia Law, clerkship with a federal judge. Nothing in his background suggested any connection to the Ashworths.

Until I ran his mother's maiden name.

Reid. Thomas Reid's mother was born Patricia Reid—daughter of Harrison Reid, who had been Eleanor Ashworth's personal driver for fifteen years.

Harrison Reid had died in 1997, supposedly of natural causes. But when I pulled his death certificate, I found a familiar pattern: sudden heart attack at age fifty-two, no prior history of cardiac problems, death occurring just three weeks after Eleanor fired him without explanation.

Thomas Reid's mother had been nineteen when her father died. Within a year, she'd received a full scholarship to Yale—a scholarship funded by a charitable foundation that, according to Catherine Webb's documents, had been one of Eleanor's money-laundering operations.

Eleanor had killed Harrison Reid—I was certain of it now—and then paid to educate his daughter as a way of ensuring silence. Now Harrison's grandson was working to free Julian Ashworth.

The question was whether Thomas Reid knew the truth about his grandfather's death.

---

I found Reid at a coffee shop near the courthouse, reviewing documents over a latte. He was young, earnest-looking, with the kind of carefully cultivated appearance that suggested he'd rehearsed every detail of his image in front of a mirror.

"Mr. Reid. I'm Detective Marlowe."

He looked up, and I saw a flash of recognition—quickly suppressed—cross his features. "Detective. I'm not sure we should be talking. The Ashworth case—"

"I'm not here about the case. I'm here about your grandfather."

That stopped him. His hands tightened around his coffee cup, and the careful composure cracked just slightly.

"My grandfather died when I was a child. I don't see how—"

"Harrison Reid. Eleanor Ashworth's driver. Died of a heart attack three weeks after she fired him." I sat down across from him, uninvited. "Do you know why she fired him?"

Reid's face went pale. "Detective, I really don't think—"

"She fired him because he saw something he wasn't supposed to see. I don't know what—maybe it was a meeting she wanted kept private, maybe it was a document she left in the car, maybe it was something she said during a phone call she thought he couldn't hear." I leaned forward. "Whatever it was, it was enough to get him killed. And then Eleanor paid for your mother's education to keep the family quiet."

"That's—that's speculation. You don't have any proof—"

"I have Eleanor Ashworth's financial records. I have the charitable foundation's tax filings. I have your mother's scholarship application, which was approved despite her grades being below the stated requirements." I watched his face, reading the war between denial and dawning horror. "I know what Eleanor was, Mr. Reid. And I think, deep down, you've always suspected."

Reid's hands were shaking now. He set down his coffee cup with exaggerated care, as if afraid it might shatter.

"What do you want?"

"I want to know who you're really working for. Geoffrey Crane doesn't have the connections or the resources to threaten David Sterling's daughter. Someone else is pulling the strings on Julian Ashworth's defense. Someone who wants him free badly enough to use the same tactics Eleanor used for fifty years."

For a long moment, Reid said nothing. I could see the calculations happening behind his eyes—the weighing of risks, the assessment of loyalties, the slow realization that he was caught between forces he didn't fully understand.

"I don't know who they are," he finally said. "I was approached six months ago by a man who said he represented 'interested parties' who wanted to ensure the Ashworth family's legacy was protected. He said they would provide funding for Julian's defense in exchange for... certain considerations."

"What kind of considerations?"

"Information about the prosecution's strategy. Access to discovery documents. Advance notice of witness lists." Reid's voice dropped to a whisper. "I thought I was just helping a wealthy client protect their interests. I didn't know about the threats to Sterling's daughter. I didn't know about any of this."

"Who was the man who approached you?"

"I only met him once. Average height, average build, forgettable face. He called himself Mr. Smith, which was obviously fake." Reid reached into his briefcase and pulled out a business card. "This is how I contacted him when I had information to report."

I took the card. It was plain white, expensive stock, with nothing but a phone number printed in black ink.

"There's one more thing." Reid's voice was barely audible now. "The motion to dismiss—it wasn't our idea. Crane thought we had a strong case on the merits. But Mr. Smith insisted we file it. He said it was essential that Detective Marlowe be removed from the case entirely, regardless of whether Julian was ultimately convicted."

I stared at him. "They're not trying to free Julian. They're trying to discredit me."

"I don't know what they're trying to do. But your conflict of interest was the focus of every conversation we had. Mr. Smith knew things about your family—things that weren't in any public record. He said that if we could prove you were personally motivated, the entire investigation would collapse."

The pieces were beginning to fit together now, forming a picture I didn't want to see. Someone had been watching me since the beginning of this case—maybe longer. Someone who knew about my grandmother, about Marcus Webb, about the photograph I kept face-down on my kitchen table.

Someone who was still pulling strings from the shadows, even with the network in ruins.

"Thank you, Mr. Reid." I pocketed the business card. "I'd recommend you find a new job. And if Mr. Smith contacts you again, call me immediately."

I left him sitting there, staring into his cold coffee, looking like a man who'd just realized he'd been swimming with sharks.

---

The phone number on the card was disconnected—of course it was. Whoever was behind this had learned from Eleanor's mistakes, covering their tracks with professional precision.

But they'd made one error. They'd let Thomas Reid see their face, even briefly. And thanks to Patricia Webb's photograph, I now had an image of the same man who'd been following Sterling's daughter.

Margaret ran both images through every database she could access. Federal. State. Military. Interpol. Nothing.

"He's a ghost," she said, frustration evident in her voice. "Either he's never been arrested, never served in any government capacity, never had a passport or driver's license... or someone scrubbed his records clean."

"Eleanor kept records of everyone who worked for her. If he was part of the network—"

"Then he'd be in the files we recovered. But he's not." Margaret spread her hands. "James, I've been chasing Eleanor Ashworth's shadow for thirty years. I've learned every trick she used, every method she employed. This man—whoever he is—operates differently. He's not in her records because he wasn't part of her organization."

"Then who is he working for?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" Margaret pulled up a chair, facing me with the intensity I'd come to associate with her most serious conversations. "Eleanor didn't create the corruption in Millbrook. She inherited it. The Ashworth family has been manipulating this town for four generations—your grandmother's story is just one chapter in a much longer history."

"You think there's something older than Eleanor? Something she was part of but didn't control?"

"I think Eleanor was powerful, but she wasn't unique. The network we've been dismantling—Morrison, Caldwell, Harper—they were her people. But what if there's another layer? A group that Eleanor answered to, or at least cooperated with?" Margaret's voice was quiet, careful. "What if the reason we can't find this man is because he belongs to a part of the system that Eleanor herself never documented?"

The thought was chilling. We'd been so focused on bringing down Eleanor's empire that we'd never considered the possibility that her empire was just a branch office.

"If that's true, then Julian isn't the target. The Ashworth fortune isn't the goal." I felt the weight of Marcus's ring on my finger, the cold certainty settling in my chest. "They're protecting something else. Something we haven't found yet."

"Something worth threatening witnesses and sabotaging trials to keep hidden."

My phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number, just three words:

*Check the wine cellar.*

---

The Ashworth estate was quiet when I arrived—quiet in the way only empty houses can be, the silence pressing against the walls like something physical. The officers who'd been maintaining the crime scene had been reassigned weeks ago, and the estate now sat waiting for the legal proceedings that would determine its fate.

I'd been in this house a dozen times during the investigation, but I'd never searched the wine cellar. There had been no reason to—Eleanor had died in the library, and all the evidence pointed to areas on the main floor and upper levels.

Now, as I descended the narrow stairs into the basement, I wondered what I'd missed.

The cellar was larger than I'd expected—a sprawling space that extended beneath most of the ground floor, with brick walls and vaulted ceilings that spoke to the mansion's nineteenth-century origins. Wine racks lined the walls, most of them empty now, their bottles long since consumed or removed. The air smelled of dust and old wood and something else, something that nagged at the edge of my memory.

I moved through the rows of racks, my flashlight cutting through the darkness. Nothing seemed out of place. Nothing seemed significant.

And then I found it.

A section of wall at the far end of the cellar, where the brick pattern was subtly different—newer than the surrounding stone, the mortar cleaner, the alignment just slightly off. I pressed against it, felt it give slightly under my hand.

A false wall.

It took me ten minutes to find the mechanism—a wine bottle that didn't actually contain wine, mounted in a rack at shoulder height. When I turned it, something clicked behind the wall, and a section of brick swung inward.

Behind it was a room.

Not large—maybe ten feet by fifteen—but packed with filing cabinets and document boxes and equipment I didn't immediately recognize. Computer terminals that looked at least a decade old sat on metal tables, their screens dark. A paper shredder stood in one corner, its basket overflowing with ribbons of destroyed documents.

And on the far wall, in frames arranged with almost religious precision, hung photographs.

Photographs of men and women I didn't recognize, dressed in styles that spanned fifty years or more. Photographs of buildings, meetings, handshakes. Photographs of newspaper headlines, clipped and mounted and annotated in handwriting I was beginning to recognize.

Eleanor's handwriting.

But it wasn't Eleanor's face that looked out from the largest photograph, mounted in the center of the wall like a portrait of a saint.

It was a man. Silver-haired, patrician features, eyes that held the cold calculation I'd come to associate with the Ashworth family. The plaque beneath the photograph bore a simple inscription:

*Founding Member*
*1952-2019*
*"The Foundation Endures"*

I didn't recognize him. But the date of his death—just three years ago—meant he'd been alive and active until recently. Whoever this man was, he'd been part of something that Eleanor had served, something that had existed for at least seventy years.

And somewhere in this room was the evidence that would explain what that something was.

I pulled out my phone to call Margaret.

It was dead. Not out of battery—completely inoperable, as if the signal had been blocked by something in the walls.

Behind me, the secret door swung shut with a soft click.

And in the darkness beyond my flashlight's beam, I heard footsteps.

"Detective Marlowe." The voice was male, soft, cultured—the voice of someone who'd never had to raise it to be obeyed. "I was hoping we could have a conversation."

I turned, my hand moving toward my weapon.

"I wouldn't recommend that." The man stepped into the light—average height, average build, forgettable face. The same man from Patricia Webb's photograph. The same man who'd threatened Sterling's daughter. "We have so much to discuss, and so little time. The Foundation has questions about your investigation."

"The Foundation?"

"All in good time, Detective." He smiled—a small, cold expression that never reached his eyes. "All in good time."
