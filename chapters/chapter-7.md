# Reckoning at the Boathouse

The Ashworth marina sat at the edge of Millbrook, where the town's pretensions of normalcy gave way to the cold, honest brutality of the water. I parked my car a quarter-mile away and walked the rest of the distance in darkness. The photograph was tucked inside my jacket like a wound pressed against my heart.

Nine o'clock. The appointed hour.

The boathouse loomed at the end of a weathered dock, its wooden frame silver-gray with age and salt. No lights showed through the windows, but I could feel someone waiting inside. A presence that made the air itself seem heavy with expectation.

I'd told Reyes where I was going. She'd argued, threatened, nearly ordered me not to come. But in the end, she'd understood. This wasn't just about Eleanor Ashworth anymore. This was about my family, my past, the questions I'd been too afraid to ask for twenty years.

"Some ghosts you have to face alone," she'd said, pressing a backup weapon into my hand. "But you call me the second something goes wrong. And Marlowe? Don't be a hero."

I hadn't promised anything.

The dock creaked under my weight as I approached, each step announcing my arrival to whoever waited inside. My hand rested on my service weapon, but I didn't draw it. Not yet. Something told me that guns weren't the currency being exchanged tonight.

The boathouse door was ajar. I pushed it open and stepped inside.

Moonlight filtered through gaps in the roof, casting silver bars across a space cluttered with boat equipment, coiled ropes, and the smell of old canvas. A figure stood at the far end, silhouetted against a window that overlooked the black water of the lake.

"You came alone." The voice was still distorted, still wrong, but there was something different about the posture now. Less threatening. More tired. "I wasn't sure you would."

"I came for answers." I kept my distance, scanning the shadows for any sign of additional threats. "And you're going to give them to me."

A dry laugh. "Always the detective. Always looking for evidence, facts, certainties." The figure turned slightly, and I caught the glint of eyes behind a dark mask. "But some truths can't be proven, Marlowe. Some things have to be believed."

"Try me."

The figure was silent for a long moment. Then: "Did you bring the photograph?"

I pulled it from my jacket, holding it up so the moonlight caught the glass. "My grandmother. My father. And Eleanor Ashworth, watching from the shadows." I paused. "You knew about this before I did. How?"

"Because I know everything about Eleanor Ashworth's crimes. I've been collecting them for years, piece by piece, victim by victim." The figure moved closer, and I tensed, but they stopped just outside arm's reach. "Your grandmother wasn't Eleanor's first victim, Detective. And she wasn't her last. But she was special. She represented something Eleanor never got over."

"Marcus Webb."

"Yes." The word was heavy with old grief. "Marcus loved your grandmother. Chose her over Eleanor. And Eleanor couldn't tolerate that—couldn't accept that anyone would reject her. So she destroyed them both."

"I know that part. Rosa told me. The lies, the forced marriage, Marcus's death." I stepped closer, ignoring the way the figure tensed. "What I don't know is what this has to do with my father. Why is he in this photograph? Why was Eleanor watching him?"

The figure was very still. When they spoke again, the distortion seemed to falter, showing cracks of a real voice beneath.

"Because your father wasn't who you think he was, Marlowe. And neither was your grandmother's husband."

My stomach dropped. "What the hell does that mean?"

"Your grandfather. The man who raised your father. He married your grandmother after Eleanor's lies destroyed her reputation. He was a good man. Kind. Willing to give a ruined woman a fresh start." The figure paused. "But your grandmother was already pregnant when they married."

The dock seemed to tilt beneath my feet. "No."

"The baby she carried wasn't his. It was Marcus Webb's." The figure's voice cracked, and for a moment, the distortion failed completely. A woman's voice emerged, old and grief-worn. "Your father was Marcus's son. Which makes you—"

"Marcus Webb's grandson." I barely recognized my own voice. "That's impossible. My grandfather. My father. They never said."

"They didn't know. Your grandmother kept the secret her entire life, terrified that Eleanor would find out. If Eleanor had learned that Marcus's bloodline had survived, that he'd left something of himself behind—" The figure shook her head. "She would have destroyed your father too. Just like she destroyed everyone else who reminded her of what she'd lost."

I stood in the darkness, feeling my entire understanding of my family. Of myself. All of it crumbling into something new and terrible.

"Who are you?" I asked, though part of me already knew.

Slowly, deliberately, the figure reached up and removed the mask.

Catherine Webb looked at me with eyes that held forty years of grief and a lifetime of searching.

"I'm your great-aunt, Detective Marlowe. Marcus's sister." Her voice was steady now, free of distortion. "I've been looking for you for a very long time."

We sat on overturned crates in the darkness, the photograph between us like a bridge spanning decades. Catherine. My great-aunt. I still couldn't fully process it.

She didn't speak. Instead, she reached into a worn leather satchel and began placing items on the crate between us, one by one. Each object caught the moonlight like a piece of evidence at a crime scene.

A faded shipping company manifest from 1964.

A series of canceled checks, the amounts blacked out but the signatures visible.

A dog-eared address book with certain names circled in red.

And finally, a small cassette tape, its label reading simply: *M.W. - Final Recording*.

"I was fifteen when Marcus died," Catherine said, her voice barely above a whisper. "They told us it was an accident. But Marcus sent me this tape two days before the crane 'malfunctioned.'" She pressed play on a small recorder she'd brought.

A man's voice crackled through the speaker—young, frightened, but steady: *"Katie, if you're hearing this, something's happened to me. I want you to look at the shipping manifest from June 3rd. Look at who signed off on the crane inspection. Then look at the checks Eleanor writes every month—the ones that go to a P.O. box in Florida. Follow the money, Katie. The money always tells the truth."*

The recording clicked off. I stared at the manifest on the crate.

"You followed the trail."

"For forty years." Catherine spread the documents out. "The crane inspector—his signature is on this manifest. Six months after Marcus died, he retired to Florida. Started receiving monthly payments from a shell company." She pointed to one of the canceled checks. "A shell company whose registered agent was David Sterling."

I picked up the address book. The names circled in red—I recognized two of them from the Ashworth investigation.

"These people..."

"All dead. All within five years of Marcus. All 'accidents' or 'natural causes.'" Catherine's hands were trembling now. "I've spent four decades mapping Eleanor's victims. Every time I got close, witnesses disappeared. Evidence vanished. But I kept copies. I kept everything."

I looked at the items spread before me—a paper trail of murder spanning half a century. But something was missing.

"My grandmother. Where does she fit?"

Catherine reached into her satchel one final time and pulled out a bundle of letters tied with faded ribbon. She didn't hand them to me—instead, she untied the ribbon and fanned them out, letting me see the dates. The earliest was from 1994. The latest was three days before my grandmother died.

"Read the first one," Catherine said. "Just the opening paragraph."

I picked it up. My grandmother's handwriting. My throat tightened.

*Dear Catherine—I know who you are. I know what you've been searching for. Marcus spoke of you often, in those last months. He said you were stubborn enough to find the truth someday. I think that day has come. But I can't tell you everything in a letter. There's too much risk. Instead, I'll tell you where to look...*

The letter continued with a series of cryptic instructions—locations, dates, names written in code.

"She didn't give me answers," Catherine said. "She gave me a map. It took me another thirty years to decode it all." She met my eyes. "Your grandmother was a detective at heart, James. She gathered evidence her entire life, hiding it in places Eleanor would never think to look. She was waiting for someone who could use it."

"Someone like you."

"Someone like you." Catherine stood slowly. "I'm dying. Cancer has seen to that. But before I go, I need to know this evidence will end up in the right hands." She gestured at the documents. "Take them. Follow the trail your grandmother laid out. I've decoded most of it, but there are pieces I could never find—pieces she hid specifically for family to discover."

I stared at the paper trail of forty years' worth of investigation. "Why not just tell me everything you know?"

Catherine smiled—thin, sharp, knowing. "Because your grandmother understood something important: the truths we discover ourselves are the ones we fight for. If I just handed you a list of names and crimes, you'd have information. But if you follow the trail, you'll have understanding. You'll know not just what Eleanor did, but *how*. And the how is what will bring down everyone who helped her."

I gathered the documents carefully, my mind already racing through the connections. The shipping manifest led to the crane inspector. The checks led to Sterling. The address book contained names I needed to cross-reference.

"The person working with you inside the house," I said. "The one with the burner phone. They attacked Rosa and me."

"I know. They panicked when you got too close." Catherine pulled her coat tight. "I've never met them face to face. Only encrypted messages, dead drops. They know the house, know the family—but they've never revealed themselves. Not even to me."

"Then how do I find them?"

Catherine reached into her pocket and produced a small object—a ring, gold with an intricate leaf pattern. "They sent me this as proof of their access. It's been in the Ashworth family for five generations. Only someone inside the house could have taken it."

I turned the ring over in my hands. An heirloom. A clue. Another piece of the puzzle my grandmother had spent her life assembling.

"The question now," Catherine said, "is what you're going to do with all of it."

I met her eyes. "I'm going to follow every trail. Find every connection. And when I'm done, the truth will be public—all of it. Eleanor's crimes *and* whoever killed her."

"Even if justice means your own family gets dragged through the mud?"

"Justice doesn't play favorites." I gathered the documents into my jacket. "That's what makes it justice."

Catherine studied me for a long moment. Something shifted in her expression—not quite approval, but close.

"You're more like Marcus than you know," she said finally. "Stubborn. Principled. The kind of man who follows the trail no matter where it leads." She turned toward the door. "I've pointed you in the right direction. The rest of the path is yours to walk."

"Wait." I rose too, blocking her path. "The informant. You said they were inside the house. There has to be something. Some clue to their identity."

Catherine hesitated. "There is one thing. When we first made contact, they sent me something. A token of good faith, they called it. Proof that they were who they claimed to be."

"What was it?"

She reached into her pocket and produced a small object, placing it in my palm. A ring. Gold, with an intricate pattern of leaves etched into the band. I recognized it immediately.

"This is from the Ashworth collection," I said. "I saw pictures of it in the family archives. Eleanor's mother wore it."

"Her grandmother, actually. It's been in the family for five generations." Catherine's eyes met mine. "Only someone with intimate access to the Ashworth heirlooms could have gotten their hands on it. Someone who knew the family secrets."

I stared at the ring, feeling the weight of it in my hand. Victor? Diana? Margot? Julian? Sterling? Any of them could have taken it. Any of them could have been feeding information to Catherine for months.

"There's one more thing," Catherine said. "The last message I received from my informant, just before Eleanor died. It was different from the others. More personal. More emotional. It said: 'She took everything from me. Now I'm going to take everything from her. When it's done, the truth will come out. But I need you to trust me. I need you to understand why.'"

"Why what?"

Catherine shook her head. "They didn't say. The message ended there. And then Eleanor was dead, and I thought I understood." She paused. "But the three methods—that's not what I expected. That's not what we planned."

"What did you plan?"

"Justice. Exposure. Public ruin." Her voice hardened. "I wanted Eleanor to face the world knowing everyone knew what she'd done. I wanted her to live with the shame. Death was too good for her."

"But your informant had other ideas."

"Apparently." Catherine moved toward the door, and this time I didn't stop her. "Find them, Detective. Find out what really happened that night. And when you do." She paused at the threshold, looking back at me with those grief-worn eyes. "Remember that Eleanor Ashworth destroyed my family. Destroyed yours. Remember that before you judge whoever finally made her pay."

She disappeared into the darkness. She left me alone with the ring and the photograph. And the terrible weight of a truth I'd never asked for.

---

I drove back to the estate in a daze, my mind churning through everything Catherine had told me. Marcus Webb was my great-uncle. My father was illegitimate. My entire family history was built on a lie. A necessary lie. But a lie nonetheless.

And somewhere in that Gothic mansion, someone had been planning Eleanor's downfall for months. Someone who had stolen a family heirloom to prove their bona fides. Someone who had promised justice and delivered murder instead.

The house was dark when I arrived. Except for a light in the library. The same room where Eleanor had died. I parked and sat in the silence, staring at the mansion's black silhouette.

My phone buzzed. A message from Reyes:

*Search turned up nothing. No burner phone. Either it's been destroyed or hidden somewhere we haven't looked.*

I typed back: *I have new information. Need to talk. Meeting in one hour.*

Her reply was immediate: *Where have you been? Catherine Webb never showed at the station. Officers lost her at the airport.*

I stared at the screen, a cold feeling settling in my gut. *She found me. We talked. She's Marcus Webb's sister. Apparently my great-aunt. Long story. Will explain.*

Before Reyes could respond, movement caught my eye. A figure emerged from the house's side door, moving quickly across the lawn toward the old chapel. Tall, slender, wrapped in a dark coat.

Margot Ashworth.

I killed my headlights and stepped out of the car, following at a distance. She moved with purpose, her footsteps crunching on the frosted grass, her breath misting in the cold air. She didn't look back. She didn't see me.

The chapel loomed ahead, the same place where Rosa and I had been attacked the night before. Police tape still crossed the entrance, but Margot ducked beneath it without hesitation.

I waited a moment, then followed.

Inside, the chapel was darker than I remembered. Moonlight filtered through broken stained glass, casting colored shadows across the dusty floor. Margot stood at the altar, holding something in her hands. Something that glinted in the dim light.

A phone. A burner phone.

"I know you're there, Detective." Her voice was calm, unsurprised. "I wondered when you'd find me."

I stepped out of the shadows, my hand on my weapon. "Margot. You're the informant."

She turned to face me, and in the moonlight, I could see that she'd been crying. But her eyes were dry now, her face composed into something like resignation.

"I've been waiting thirty years for this," she said. "For someone to find out. For someone to finally understand what Eleanor did to me. To all of us." She held up the burner phone. "I contacted Catherine Webb three months ago. Told her I had information about her brother's death. About Eleanor's crimes."

"Why?"

"Because I was tired." The words came out like a confession. "Tired of living in this prison. Eating at her table. Pretending to be grateful for the scraps she threw me. She destroyed my life, Detective. Paid off the only man I ever loved. Left me empty and broken and alone." Margot's voice cracked. "I wanted her to suffer. I wanted the world to know what she really was."

"So you helped Catherine build a case against her."

"Yes. I fed her documents, names, dates. Evidence I'd been collecting for years, hidden away in my room where Eleanor never thought to look." Margot laughed bitterly. "She thought I was nothing. A ghost. She never suspected I was watching her, documenting everything, waiting for the right moment to strike."

"But you didn't just expose her. You killed her."

Margot went very still. "I didn't kill her."

"You have the burner phone. You had access to her food, her movements. You knew when she'd be alone."

"I had opportunity. I had motive. But I didn't kill her." Her eyes met mine, fierce and unwavering. "I was going to, Detective. That night, after dinner, I made up my mind. I'd spent thirty years in this purgatory, and I couldn't take another day. I was going to go to the library, confront her, and finally make her pay for what she'd done."

"What stopped you?"

"Someone beat me to it." Margot's composure cracked, and I saw the terror beneath. "I went to the library at midnight. The door was ajar. I could see Eleanor at her desk, slumped over, barely conscious. And standing over her—" She broke off, shaking her head.

"Who?"

"I couldn't see clearly. The light was dim. But there was someone there, their hands around her throat." Margot's voice dropped to a whisper. "They were strangling her. And then they heard something—footsteps in the hallway, maybe, or a door closing—and they stopped. They fled through the garden door before I could see their face."

"What did you do?"

"I ran. I went to the conservatory and hid until Rosa found the body." Tears streamed down her face now. "I'm a coward, Detective. I spent thirty years dreaming of revenge, but when the moment came, I couldn't even finish what someone else started."

I stared at her, this fragile, broken woman who had plotted her mother's downfall from the shadows.

"You saw the strangler," I said. "You're the only witness. You have to give me something. Height, build, any detail."

Margot closed her eyes, her face twisted with effort. "Tall. Broad shoulders. They moved like someone young. Quick. Desperate."

A chill ran down my spine. Tall. Broad shoulders. Young.

Julian Ashworth.

"I need the burner phone," I said, extending my hand. "And I need you to tell Captain Reyes everything you just told me."

Margot handed over the phone without resistance. "Is it over? Is this finally over?"

I thought about Victor's embezzlement, Diana's silent rage, Julian's convenient alibis. I thought about poison, strangulation, and a letter opener that Eleanor had turned on herself.

"Not yet," I said. "But it will be soon."

I led Margot out of the chapel, my mind already racing ahead to the confrontation that was coming. The strangler had been interrupted. Margot had seen them flee. And now I had a witness, a phone full of evidence, and a suspect I didn't want to believe was guilty.

The night was just beginning. And before it was over, the Ashworth family would have one more secret to bury.
