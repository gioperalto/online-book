# Reckoning at the Boathouse

The Ashworth marina sat at the edge of Millbrook, where the town's pretensions of normalcy gave way to the cold, honest brutality of the water. I parked my car a quarter-mile away and walked the rest of the distance in darkness. The photograph was tucked inside my jacket like a wound pressed against my heart.

Nine o'clock. The appointed hour.

The boathouse loomed at the end of a weathered dock, its wooden frame silver-gray with age and salt. No lights showed through the windows, but I could feel someone waiting inside. A presence that made the air itself seem heavy with expectation.

I'd told Reyes where I was going. She'd argued, threatened, nearly ordered me not to come. But in the end, she'd understood. This wasn't just about Eleanor Ashworth anymore. This was about my family, my past, the questions I'd been too afraid to ask for twenty years.

"Some ghosts you have to face alone," she'd said, pressing a backup weapon into my hand. "But you call me the second something goes wrong. And Marlowe? Don't be a hero."

I hadn't promised anything.

The dock creaked under my weight as I approached, each step announcing my arrival to whoever waited inside. My hand rested on my service weapon, but I didn't draw it. Not yet. Something told me that guns weren't the currency being exchanged tonight.

The boathouse door was ajar. I pushed it open and stepped inside.

Moonlight filtered through gaps in the roof, casting silver bars across a space cluttered with boat equipment, coiled ropes, and the smell of old canvas. A figure stood at the far end, silhouetted against a window that overlooked the black water of the lake.

"You came alone." The voice was still distorted, still wrong, but there was something different about the posture now. Less threatening. More tired. "I wasn't sure you would."

"I came for answers." I kept my distance, scanning the shadows for any sign of additional threats. "And you're going to give them to me."

A dry laugh. "Always the detective. Always looking for evidence, facts, certainties." The figure turned slightly, and I caught the glint of eyes behind a dark mask. "But some truths can't be proven, Marlowe. Some things have to be believed."

"Try me."

The figure was silent for a long moment. Then: "Did you bring the photograph?"

I pulled it from my jacket, holding it up so the moonlight caught the glass. "My grandmother. My father. And Eleanor Ashworth, watching from the shadows." I paused. "You knew about this before I did. How?"

"Because I know everything about Eleanor Ashworth's crimes. I've been collecting them for years, piece by piece, victim by victim." The figure moved closer, and I tensed, but they stopped just outside arm's reach. "Your grandmother wasn't Eleanor's first victim, Detective. And she wasn't her last. But she was special. She represented something Eleanor never got over."

"Marcus Webb."

"Yes." The word was heavy with old grief. "Marcus loved your grandmother. Chose her over Eleanor. And Eleanor couldn't tolerate that—couldn't accept that anyone would reject her. So she destroyed them both."

"I know that part. Rosa told me. The lies, the forced marriage, Marcus's death." I stepped closer, ignoring the way the figure tensed. "What I don't know is what this has to do with my father. Why is he in this photograph? Why was Eleanor watching him?"

The figure was very still. When they spoke again, the distortion seemed to falter, showing cracks of a real voice beneath.

"Because your father wasn't who you think he was, Marlowe. And neither was your grandmother's husband."

My stomach dropped. "What the hell does that mean?"

"Your grandfather. The man who raised your father. He married your grandmother after Eleanor's lies destroyed her reputation. He was a good man. Kind. Willing to give a ruined woman a fresh start." The figure paused. "But your grandmother was already pregnant when they married."

The dock seemed to tilt beneath my feet. "No."

"The baby she carried wasn't his. It was Marcus Webb's." The figure's voice cracked, and for a moment, the distortion failed completely. A woman's voice emerged, old and grief-worn. "Your father was Marcus's son. Which makes you—"

"Marcus Webb's grandson." I barely recognized my own voice. "That's impossible. My grandfather. My father. They never said."

"They didn't know. Your grandmother kept the secret her entire life, terrified that Eleanor would find out. If Eleanor had learned that Marcus's bloodline had survived, that he'd left something of himself behind—" The figure shook her head. "She would have destroyed your father too. Just like she destroyed everyone else who reminded her of what she'd lost."

I stood in the darkness, feeling my entire understanding of my family. Of myself. All of it crumbling into something new and terrible.

"Who are you?" I asked, though part of me already knew.

Slowly, deliberately, the figure reached up and removed the mask.

Catherine Webb looked at me with eyes that held forty years of grief and a lifetime of searching.

"I'm your great-aunt, Detective Marlowe. Marcus's sister." Her voice was steady now, free of distortion. "I've been looking for you for a very long time."

We sat on overturned crates in the darkness, the photograph between us like a bridge spanning decades. Catherine. My great-aunt. I still couldn't fully process it. She spoke in a quiet, measured voice, laying out a history I'd never known existed.

"I was fifteen when Marcus died. They told us it was an accident at the shipping yard. A crane malfunction, they said. But I never believed it. Marcus was careful. Methodical. He didn't make mistakes."

"You think Eleanor had him killed."

"I know she did. It took me forty years to prove it, but I found the records. Payments to a dock foreman who retired to Florida six months later. A crane inspector who signed off on equipment he never examined. A trail of money and silence leading straight back to the Ashworth family." Catherine's hands trembled as she spoke. "Eleanor murdered my brother because he dared to love someone else. And when she found out your grandmother was pregnant, she would have killed the baby too. Killed your father before he was ever born. If your grandmother hadn't hidden the truth."

"How do you know all this?"

"Your grandmother told me. Not everything. Not at first. But enough." Catherine reached into her coat and produced a bundle of letters, yellowed with age. "After Marcus died, I tried to find your grandmother. To tell her I knew what Eleanor had done, to see if she knew anything that could help me prove it. But she'd disappeared. Married. Moved away. Changed her name. I didn't find her until decades later, when she was already old and dying."

I took the letters with hands that didn't quite feel like my own. The handwriting was my grandmother's. I recognized it from birthday cards and recipes. From a lifetime of small, familiar moments.

"She wrote to me," Catherine continued. "After we reconnected. She told me about Marcus, about the pregnancy, about the terror she'd lived with every day. The fear that Eleanor would discover the truth and come for her son." Catherine's eyes met mine. "Your father never knew who his real father was. Your grandmother took that secret to her grave. But she wanted someone to know. She wanted someone to make sure Eleanor's crimes didn't stay buried forever."

I thought about my father. Quiet. Withdrawn. A man who'd spent his life running from something he couldn't name. I thought about my grandmother, dying alone in a hospital bed while Eleanor Ashworth prospered in her Gothic mansion. I thought about Marcus Webb, a young man who'd loved the wrong woman and paid for it with his life.

"Why now?" I asked. "Why come forward after all this time?"

"Because I'm dying." Catherine said it simply, without drama. "Cancer. The doctors give me three months, maybe less. I've spent my whole life trying to bring Eleanor to justice, but the system was rigged. She owned everyone who could have helped. When I finally had enough evidence to expose her, I realized the only way to make it stick was to find someone Eleanor couldn't buy or threaten." She looked at me. "Someone with a personal stake. Someone who would see it through to the end."

"You've been calling the estate. Threatening her."

"Preparing her." Catherine's smile was thin, sharp. "I wanted her to know it was coming. To feel the fear she'd made so many others feel. And I wanted to draw her out, to see how she'd react when the walls started closing in."

"But someone killed her before you could finish."

Catherine was silent for a moment. "Yes. Someone took my justice away from me. Someone who knew what she'd done and decided to end it their own way."

"Who?"

"I don't know. I thought I did. I thought I knew every secret in that house. But the murder surprised me." She paused. "The three methods surprised me more."

"You know about the poison, the strangulation, the stabbing."

"I know someone in that house was working with me. Feeding me information. When I heard what happened to Eleanor, I assumed they'd acted. But three methods? That suggests something more complicated."

"Your informant," I said, my mind racing. "The person with the burner phone. Who is it?"

Catherine shook her head. "I don't know. We communicated through encrypted messages, dead drops. They never revealed their identity. They said it was safer that way. For both of us."

"They attacked Rosa and me at the chapel."

"I know. They called me afterward, panicked. Said things were spinning out of control, that the investigation was getting too close." Catherine's eyes were troubled. "They didn't want to hurt you. They wanted to scare you off. But they knew you wouldn't stop. Not once you learned about your grandmother. About Marcus."

"So they brought me here. Used you to tell me the truth."

"Used me?" Catherine laughed bitterly. "I've been using them. Using everyone. I've spent forty years building this case, and I wasn't going to let anything derail it. Not Rosa's evidence. Not your investigation. Not even Eleanor's murder." She leaned forward. "The question now is what you're going to do with the truth."

I looked at the photograph, at my grandmother's face, at my father as a teenager. A boy who'd never known his real father. A man who'd lived his whole life in shadow.

"I'm going to find out who killed Eleanor Ashworth," I said. "Not for her sake. For justice."

"Even if justice means protecting her killers?"

I met Catherine's eyes. "Justice doesn't work that way. Eleanor committed crimes. Terrible crimes. But so did whoever murdered her. If there's evidence of what she did, I'll make sure it sees the light. But I won't let her killers walk free just because their victim deserved what she got."

Catherine studied me for a long moment. Something in her expression shifted. Disappointment, maybe. Or a grudging respect.

"You're more like Marcus than you know," she said finally. "He was the same way. Stubborn. Principled. Unwilling to compromise, even when compromise would have saved him." She stood, gathering her coat around her. "I've given you what I came to give. The rest is up to you."

"Wait." I rose too, blocking her path. "The informant. You said they were inside the house. There has to be something. Some clue to their identity."

Catherine hesitated. "There is one thing. When we first made contact, they sent me something. A token of good faith, they called it. Proof that they were who they claimed to be."

"What was it?"

She reached into her pocket and produced a small object, placing it in my palm. A ring. Gold, with an intricate pattern of leaves etched into the band. I recognized it immediately.

"This is from the Ashworth collection," I said. "I saw pictures of it in the family archives. Eleanor's mother wore it."

"Her grandmother, actually. It's been in the family for five generations." Catherine's eyes met mine. "Only someone with intimate access to the Ashworth heirlooms could have gotten their hands on it. Someone who knew the family secrets."

I stared at the ring, feeling the weight of it in my hand. Victor? Diana? Margot? Julian? Sterling? Any of them could have taken it. Any of them could have been feeding information to Catherine for months.

"There's one more thing," Catherine said. "The last message I received from my informant, just before Eleanor died. It was different from the others. More personal. More emotional. It said: 'She took everything from me. Now I'm going to take everything from her. When it's done, the truth will come out. But I need you to trust me. I need you to understand why.'"

"Why what?"

Catherine shook her head. "They didn't say. The message ended there. And then Eleanor was dead, and I thought I understood." She paused. "But the three methods—that's not what I expected. That's not what we planned."

"What did you plan?"

"Justice. Exposure. Public ruin." Her voice hardened. "I wanted Eleanor to face the world knowing everyone knew what she'd done. I wanted her to live with the shame. Death was too good for her."

"But your informant had other ideas."

"Apparently." Catherine moved toward the door, and this time I didn't stop her. "Find them, Detective. Find out what really happened that night. And when you do." She paused at the threshold, looking back at me with those grief-worn eyes. "Remember that Eleanor Ashworth destroyed my family. Destroyed yours. Remember that before you judge whoever finally made her pay."

She disappeared into the darkness. She left me alone with the ring and the photograph. And the terrible weight of a truth I'd never asked for.

---

I drove back to the estate in a daze, my mind churning through everything Catherine had told me. Marcus Webb was my great-uncle. My father was illegitimate. My entire family history was built on a lie. A necessary lie. But a lie nonetheless.

And somewhere in that Gothic mansion, someone had been planning Eleanor's downfall for months. Someone who had stolen a family heirloom to prove their bona fides. Someone who had promised justice and delivered murder instead.

The house was dark when I arrived. Except for a light in the library. The same room where Eleanor had died. I parked and sat in the silence, staring at the mansion's black silhouette.

My phone buzzed. A message from Reyes:

*Search turned up nothing. No burner phone. Either it's been destroyed or hidden somewhere we haven't looked.*

I typed back: *I have new information. Need to talk. Meeting in one hour.*

Her reply was immediate: *Where have you been? Catherine Webb never showed at the station. Officers lost her at the airport.*

I stared at the screen, a cold feeling settling in my gut. *She found me. We talked. She's Marcus Webb's sister. Apparently my great-aunt. Long story. Will explain.*

Before Reyes could respond, movement caught my eye. A figure emerged from the house's side door, moving quickly across the lawn toward the old chapel. Tall, slender, wrapped in a dark coat.

Margot Ashworth.

I killed my headlights and stepped out of the car, following at a distance. She moved with purpose, her footsteps crunching on the frosted grass, her breath misting in the cold air. She didn't look back. She didn't see me.

The chapel loomed ahead, the same place where Rosa and I had been attacked the night before. Police tape still crossed the entrance, but Margot ducked beneath it without hesitation.

I waited a moment, then followed.

Inside, the chapel was darker than I remembered. Moonlight filtered through broken stained glass, casting colored shadows across the dusty floor. Margot stood at the altar, holding something in her hands. Something that glinted in the dim light.

A phone. A burner phone.

"I know you're there, Detective." Her voice was calm, unsurprised. "I've been expecting you."

I stepped out of the shadows, my hand on my weapon. "Margot. You're the informant."

She turned to face me, and in the moonlight, I could see that she'd been crying. But her eyes were dry now, her face composed into something like resignation.

"I've been waiting thirty years for this," she said. "For someone to find out. For someone to finally understand what Eleanor did to me. To all of us." She held up the burner phone. "I contacted Catherine Webb three months ago. Told her I had information about her brother's death. About Eleanor's crimes."

"Why?"

"Because I was tired." The words came out like a confession. "Tired of living in this prison. Eating at her table. Pretending to be grateful for the scraps she threw me. She destroyed my life, Detective. Paid off the only man I ever loved. Left me empty and broken and alone." Margot's voice cracked. "I wanted her to suffer. I wanted the world to know what she really was."

"So you helped Catherine build a case against her."

"Yes. I fed her documents, names, dates. Evidence I'd been collecting for years, hidden away in my room where Eleanor never thought to look." Margot laughed bitterly. "She thought I was nothing. A ghost. She never suspected I was watching her, documenting everything, waiting for the right moment to strike."

"But you didn't just expose her. You killed her."

Margot went very still. "I didn't kill her."

"You have the burner phone. You had access to her food, her movements. You knew when she'd be alone."

"I had opportunity. I had motive. But I didn't kill her." Her eyes met mine, fierce and unwavering. "I was going to, Detective. That night, after dinner, I made up my mind. I'd spent thirty years in this purgatory, and I couldn't take another day. I was going to go to the library, confront her, and finally make her pay for what she'd done."

"What stopped you?"

"Someone beat me to it." Margot's composure cracked, and I saw the terror beneath. "I went to the library at midnight. The door was ajar. I could see Eleanor at her desk, slumped over, barely conscious. And standing over her—" She broke off, shaking her head.

"Who?"

"I couldn't see clearly. The light was dim. But there was someone there, their hands around her throat." Margot's voice dropped to a whisper. "They were strangling her. And then they heard something—footsteps in the hallway, maybe, or a door closing—and they stopped. They fled through the garden door before I could see their face."

"What did you do?"

"I ran. I went to the conservatory and hid until Rosa found the body." Tears streamed down her face now. "I'm a coward, Detective. I spent thirty years dreaming of revenge, but when the moment came, I couldn't even finish what someone else started."

I stared at her, this fragile, broken woman who had plotted her mother's downfall from the shadows.

"You saw the strangler," I said. "You're the only witness. You have to give me something. Height, build, any detail."

Margot closed her eyes, her face twisted with effort. "Tall. Broad shoulders. They moved like someone young. Quick. Desperate."

A chill ran down my spine. Tall. Broad shoulders. Young.

Julian Ashworth.

"I need the burner phone," I said, extending my hand. "And I need you to tell Captain Reyes everything you just told me."

Margot handed over the phone without resistance. "Is it over? Is this finally over?"

I thought about Victor's embezzlement, Diana's silent rage, Julian's convenient alibis. I thought about poison, strangulation, and a letter opener that Eleanor had turned on herself.

"Not yet," I said. "But it will be soon."

I led Margot out of the chapel, my mind already racing ahead to the confrontation that was coming. The strangler had been interrupted. Margot had seen them flee. And now I had a witness, a phone full of evidence, and a suspect I didn't want to believe was guilty.

The night was just beginning. And before it was over, the Ashworth family would have one more secret to bury.
