# The Gathering Storm

The hospital room was quiet except for the steady beep of monitors and the soft hum of fluorescent lights. They'd stitched me up, pumped me full of antibiotics, and told me I was lucky—the bullet had carved a neat furrow along my ribs but hadn't hit anything vital. Lucky. That word kept coming up in this case.

My father sat in the chair beside my bed, still wearing the clothes he'd had on at the Webb house. Someone had brought him coffee, but it sat untouched on the side table, cooling in its paper cup. We'd been sitting in silence for nearly an hour, neither of us sure how to begin.

"I should have told you years ago." His voice was rough, as if the words had been scraping against the inside of his throat. "About Marcus. About your grandmother. About all of it."

"Why didn't you?"

He turned the question over, examining it from different angles. "At first, it was your grandmother's wish. She made me promise not to tell anyone—not even your mother. She was afraid of what Eleanor might do if she found out the secret had spread." He paused. "And then, after she died, it just seemed easier to let it stay buried. You had your life, your career. I didn't want to drag you into something that happened before you were born."

"But it didn't stay buried."

"No." He looked at me, and I saw the weight of sixty years of secrets in his eyes. "It never does, does it?"

The door opened before I could respond. Margaret entered, still in her FBI jacket, her face drawn with exhaustion. Behind her came someone I hadn't expected—Catherine Webb, moving slowly with a walker, a young agent at her elbow helping her navigate.

"Mrs. Webb." I tried to sit up straighter. "You shouldn't be out of—"

"I'll decide what I should and shouldn't do, young man." Her voice was thin but sharp. "I didn't live this long to miss the ending."

She settled into the other chair, breathing heavily from the exertion. The cancer was taking its toll—she'd lost weight since I'd last seen her, her skin stretched tight over her bones—but her eyes were bright, fiercely present.

"I've been briefed on what happened at the house," Margaret said, closing the door behind her. "The adjuster is in custody at the county hospital, under armed guard. Third-degree burns, possible spinal compression, but he'll survive to stand trial."

"Has he talked?"

"Not yet. But we have leverage now that we didn't have before." She pulled a folder from under her arm. "While you were in surgery, my team executed search warrants at six locations across Millbrook. Judge Harper's home. Morrison's fishing cabin. The Ashworth shipping warehouse. Three properties connected to network shell companies."

"And?"

"And the network was already one step ahead. Most of the locations had been sanitized—files destroyed, computers wiped, evidence removed." Margaret's jaw tightened. "But they missed something at Morrison's cabin. A fireproof safe, hidden under the floorboards. Inside we found records of payments going back twenty years. Names, dates, amounts. And a list."

She handed me the folder. Inside was a photocopy of a handwritten document, the ink faded but legible. A list of names with notations beside each one—some crossed out, some with checkmarks, some with question marks.

"What am I looking at?"

"Morrison's personal record of everyone on the network's payroll. Police officers, judges, city officials, business owners." Margaret pointed to a name near the bottom of the list. "Look at number forty-seven."

I scanned down until I found it. The name hit me like a punch to the chest.

*Captain Maria Reyes. Recruited 2019. Monthly: $5,000. Status: Active.*

"No." The word came out strangled. "That's not possible."

"James—"

"Reyes called the FBI. She brought you in. She's been helping me this entire investigation." I shook my head, ignoring the pain in my ribs. "This has to be a mistake. Or disinformation—something the network planted to make us doubt our allies."

"That's what I thought too. So I checked." Margaret's voice was gentle, the way you'd speak to someone receiving bad news. "Bank records show deposits of $5,000 on the first of every month since March 2019. Routed through a series of shell accounts, but traceable to Ashworth-connected entities."

"Then Eleanor was paying her without her knowledge. Setting up a frame—"

"James." Margaret held up her hand. "There's more. I pulled Reyes's phone records for the past forty-eight hours. At 6:47 this morning—three hours before you arrived at the Webb house—she made a call to a burner number. The same burner the adjuster was carrying when we took him into custody."

The beeping of the monitors seemed impossibly loud in the silence that followed.

"She warned him," I said. The words tasted like ash. "She told him I was coming."

"It appears that way, yes."

Captain Maria Reyes. Fifteen years of working together. She'd been my superior, my advocate, the one person in the department I trusted completely. She'd given me the latitude to pursue this case even when it threatened powerful people. She'd called the FBI when she learned about the conspiracy.

Or had she?

I ran through the events of the past few days with new eyes. Reyes had been with me at almost every major turning point. She'd known about my connection to the Ashworths before I'd told anyone else. She'd given me the forty-eight-hour window—had that been genuine support, or a way to track my progress and report back to the network?

"Why?" My voice came out hoarse. "If she was working for them, why help me at all?"

"Insurance," Margaret said. "The same reason Rosa Martinez collected evidence over the years. When you're part of a criminal conspiracy, you protect yourself by making sure you're valuable. Reyes positioned herself as a double agent—loyal to Eleanor's network, but also capable of feeding intelligence to the FBI if things went south."

"She was playing both sides."

"Until she had to choose. And when the network started collapsing, she chose self-preservation." Margaret sat on the edge of my bed. "She's still at large. Left her apartment two hours ago and hasn't been seen since. We have an APB out, but—"

"She knows how to disappear." I'd trained her. Taught her the techniques I used for surveillance. God, I was a fool. "What about the warehouse operation? Is it still—"

"Cancelled. The network knows we're coming, and now we know we've been compromised from the inside. We need to regroup, identify any other moles, and plan a new approach."

"We don't have time for that." Catherine Webb's voice cut through like a knife. "I'm dying, in case everyone has forgotten. I have weeks, not months. If we don't finish this now, I won't live to see justice done."

The room fell silent. Catherine's breathing was labored, each inhale a small battle.

"Mrs. Webb—" Margaret began.

"Don't 'Mrs. Webb' me. I'm your aunt too, girl." Catherine's eyes moved from Margaret to my father to me. "Three generations of Webbs in one room. Do you understand what that means? My brother died trying to expose Eleanor Ashworth. Your grandmother died carrying his secret. And now we have everything—the evidence, the testimony, the proof of sixty years of crimes—and you want to wait?"

"The operation is compromised," Margaret said. "If we move now, without knowing who else might be working for the network—"

"Then we don't use your operation. We use mine."

I sat up straighter, ignoring the pull of stitches in my side. "What are you talking about?"

Catherine smiled, and for a moment I saw the young woman she must have been—fierce, determined, the sister of a man who'd chosen truth over safety.

"You think I spent forty years just collecting evidence? I've been building something, Detective. Relationships with journalists, connections with prosecutors outside Millbrook's sphere of influence, alliances with other families that Eleanor destroyed." She leaned forward in her chair. "I have a contact at the *Detroit Free Press*—a reporter who's been waiting fifteen years for this story. And I have a friend in the U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit who would very much like to prosecute a multi-generational RICO case against what's left of the Ashworth network."

"You're talking about going public," Margaret said slowly. "Before we've arrested everyone."

"I'm talking about making it impossible for them to run. Once the story breaks—once Marcus's journal and Eleanor's files and Morrison's payment records are plastered across every newspaper in Michigan—the network members won't be able to hide. Their faces will be everywhere. Their accounts will be frozen. Their friends and family will know exactly who they are and what they've done."

"That could also compromise ongoing investigations. Warn potential defendants to destroy evidence—"

"What evidence is left to destroy?" Catherine's voice rose with frustration. "You said yourself—the locations were sanitized. They're already one step ahead. The only advantage we have is the evidence we've already secured. If we wait, if we give them time to regroup and plan, they'll find a way to spin this. To discredit us. To make it all go away."

I looked at my father. He'd been silent through the exchange, his face unreadable.

"Dad? What do you think?"

He considered for a long moment. "I think your grandmother would have wanted the truth told. Not just in a courtroom, where lawyers can muddy the waters and juries can be influenced. But in the open. Where everyone can see it."

"The victims deserve that," Catherine added. "Marcus deserves that. All the people Eleanor crushed over six decades—they deserve to have their stories heard by someone other than a judge."

Margaret rubbed her temples. "I could lose my job for this. Going outside official channels, working with journalists before the investigation is complete—"

"You've already gone outside official channels," I pointed out. "The moment you revealed yourself to me, the moment you started working with family instead of through official FBI procedures, you crossed that line."

"That's different—"

"Is it?" I met her eyes. "Margaret. You've spent thirty years building this case. Not for the FBI. For yourself. For Marcus. For the family Eleanor tried to erase. Are you really going to let bureaucratic procedure stop you now, when we're this close?"

The silence stretched between us. I could see her wrestling with it—duty versus justice, protocol versus purpose. She was an FBI agent, yes, but she was also Margaret Helen Webb. The daughter of a murdered man. The sister my father never knew.

Finally, she nodded. "What do you need from me?"

Catherine's smile widened. "Everything. Marcus's journal, Eleanor's files, Sterling's testimony, Morrison's records. I need it all organized, documented, ready to present. My contact at the *Free Press* can have a team here by tomorrow morning."

"And the U.S. Attorney?"

"I'll make the call tonight. If we're lucky, we can have federal indictments issued before the Millbrook prosecutors even know what's happening." Catherine turned to me. "Detective Marlowe. I know you're injured. I know you've been through hell these past few days. But I need you to do one more thing."

"Name it."

"The families. The victims. Over the years, I've compiled a list of everyone Eleanor hurt—the people who lost jobs, lost homes, lost loved ones. Many of them are still alive. Many of them thought they were alone, that no one would ever believe them." Catherine's voice softened. "I need someone to reach out to them. To tell them that their stories matter. That justice is finally coming."

By evening, the hospital room had become a command center. Margaret's team set up encrypted communications equipment. My father worked with Catherine to organize the decades of evidence into a coherent narrative. And I sat with a phone, making calls I should have made years ago.

The first call was to Rosa Martinez at Millbrook General. She was recovering well, the doctors said, but she'd been asking for me every few hours.

"Detective." Her voice was tired but strong. "I heard about the adjuster. Is it true? He's really captured?"

"It's true. He won't hurt anyone else."

"And Reyes? I heard she's run."

Word traveled fast in Millbrook. "We'll find her."

"I should have known." Rosa's sigh crackled through the phone. "She was always too careful, you know? Always asking questions about what I was doing, where I was going. I thought she was just being a good captain. I didn't realize she was reporting back."

"None of us did."

"There's something else I need to tell you. Something I've been holding back because I wasn't sure it mattered." Rosa paused. "The night Eleanor died—before I found the body—I saw someone in the garden. I thought it was one of the staff, but now I'm not so sure."

"Who?"

"I don't know. It was dark, and I only saw them for a second. But they were wearing something that caught the moonlight. Something metallic."

"Like a badge?"

"Maybe. Or a pendant. Or—" She stopped. "A locket. Detective, I think I saw someone in the garden wearing a gold locket."

The words hit me like ice water. The locket. My grandmother's locket—the one found in Eleanor's hand.

"Rosa. Are you sure?"

"I wasn't at the time. I convinced myself I'd imagined it. But now, with everything that's happened—" Her voice dropped. "What if someone was there that night who we haven't accounted for? What if the locket wasn't something Eleanor was holding—but something someone dropped?"

---

I hung up the phone with my mind racing. The locket had been the first puzzle piece—the object that connected me personally to Eleanor Ashworth's death. We'd assumed Eleanor was clutching it when she died, holding onto a trophy from her past crimes. But what if that assumption was wrong?

"James?" Margaret noticed the change in my expression. "What is it?"

"Rosa saw someone in the garden the night of the murder. Someone wearing a gold locket."

"Your grandmother's locket?"

"Maybe. I don't know." I swung my legs over the side of the bed, wincing at the pull in my ribs. "We've been assuming Eleanor had the locket in her possession all these years. But what if she didn't? What if someone else had it—someone who was there that night?"

"Who would—" Margaret stopped, her eyes widening. "Sarah."

The name hung in the air between us.

"Sarah was your grandmother's daughter-in-law," Margaret said slowly. "She had access to her belongings after she died. She admitted to finding letters, a diary, information about the Ashworth connection. What if she also found the locket?"

"But Sarah wasn't at the estate that night. She was in Detroit—she has an alibi."

"Does she?" Margaret pulled out her phone, scrolling through notes. "We verified she was at her mother's care facility until 9 PM. That she was home in Detroit, packing. That she took a 7:45 AM flight the next morning." She looked up at me. "But what if she wasn't home all night? Detroit to Millbrook is what—two hours by car? She could have driven here, been at the estate by midnight, and driven back before her morning flight."

"Why would she—"

"Because she hated Eleanor. For destroying her relationship with Victor. For what Eleanor did to her family. For everything." Margaret's voice was urgent now. "James, Sarah knew the Ashworth house. She'd been there before, during her relationship with Victor. She knew the layout, knew the gardens, knew where the library was."

"You're saying Sarah was at the estate. That she's the person Rosa saw in the garden."

"I'm saying it's possible. And if she was there—if she was wearing the locket—then maybe she's not just a witness to this case. Maybe she's part of it."

---

THEREFORE the investigation had taken another turn—but this time, it was pointing somewhere I'd never expected. As night fell over Millbrook and the team prepared for what might be the biggest press conference in the city's history, I found myself staring at my phone, Sarah's number glowing on the screen.

The woman I'd been married to for eight years. The woman who'd kept secrets that spanned decades. The woman who claimed to have loved me, even as she hid the truth about everything that connected us.

Had she also hidden the truth about the night Eleanor died?

There was only one way to find out.

I pressed the call button.
