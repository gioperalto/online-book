# Marcus Webb's Legacy

#### "The truth never dies. It waits. It finds a way." - Marcus Webb

The old Webb property sat at the end of a gravel road that hadn't seen maintenance in decades—a forty-minute drive from my apartment, longer because I'd taken two wrong turns before finding the unmarked road that led out here. Weeds had consumed the ditches on either side, and the morning mist hung low over the fields, turning the world into something gauzy and uncertain. I checked my watch: 6:23 AM. I killed my headlights a quarter mile out and let the car coast to a stop behind a stand of overgrown honeysuckle, the engine ticking as it cooled.

The house emerged from the fog like a memory refusing to fade. Two stories of weathered clapboard, the white paint long since surrendered to gray. A wraparound porch that sagged in the middle. Windows that stared out at the world like empty eye sockets. This was where Marcus Webb had grown up, before Eleanor Ashworth had noticed him, desired him, and ultimately destroyed him.

My father's truck was parked in the circular drive. No other vehicles that I could see—but the adjuster wouldn't announce himself with something as careless as a car in plain sight.

I drew my weapon and moved through the tall grass, staying low, watching the windows for any sign of movement. The morning was silent except for the distant call of crows and the soft crunch of my footsteps. Every shadow could be a threat. Every rustle of wind through the dead leaves sounded like someone breathing.

This was the part of the job I'd been good at, once. The stakeouts and approaches, the tactical precision that had earned me my reputation in the early years. The top brass used to assign me cases they thought were unwinnable—cold trails and protected suspects and situations where failure seemed guaranteed. But I'd learned to see what others missed, to wait longer than anyone thought reasonable, to move when the moment was right. The Kellerman kidnapping. The dockside murders. The string of pharmacy robberies that had stumped three agencies. I'd solved them all by being more patient, more stubborn, more willing to put myself in harm's way than anyone expected. Now my knees ached with every step and my reflexes weren't what they'd been, but the instincts remained. They'd have to be enough.

The front door hung open. Not broken—just open, as if someone had walked through and not bothered to close it behind them.

I stepped onto the porch, wincing at the creak of the boards. Inside, the house smelled like dust and decay, old wallpaper and older secrets. A staircase led up to the second floor, its banister thick with grime. To my right, what had once been a parlor sat empty except for a single chair, positioned to face the window that looked out over the road.

Someone had been watching. Waiting.

"Dad?" I kept my voice low. "Robert?"

No answer. I moved through the parlor into a narrow hallway. Photographs still hung on the walls—faded images of people I didn't recognize. A young couple on their wedding day. Children in Sunday clothes. A family gathered around a Christmas tree.

And there, near the end of the hall, a photograph I did recognize. Marcus Webb, young and handsome, standing in front of a shipping yard with a lunchbox in his hand. The same face I'd seen in Catherine's photographs. The same face that had been erased from history by Eleanor Ashworth.

A sound from above. Footsteps, slow and deliberate. I counted them—one, two, three—trying to gauge the direction, the weight.

I took the stairs two at a time, my weapon leading the way, each step groaning under my weight. At the top, a narrow landing split into two corridors. The footsteps had come from the left—from what looked like a bedroom at the end of the hall.

The door was closed. I pressed my back against the wall beside it, steadied my breathing.

"Millbrook Police. Come out with your hands visible."

Silence. Then, from behind the door, my father's voice: "James? Is that you?"

Relief flooded through me, followed immediately by renewed caution. "Are you alone?"

"I—I think so. I thought I heard someone downstairs earlier, but—"

"I'm coming in. Stay where you are."

I turned the knob and pushed the door open, sweeping the room with my weapon. My father stood near the window, a cardboard box at his feet. He looked older than he had at the cemetery—grayer, more fragile. But he was alive.

"Thank God." I holstered my weapon. "We need to get you out of here. Now."

"James, what's going on? I found what Catherine sent me for—it's in the box—but then I heard sounds downstairs and—"

"There's no time to explain." I crossed to him, grabbed his arm. "Someone dangerous is coming. Someone who's been eliminating witnesses connected to the Webb family."

"Catherine told me. Stories from the old days—Eleanor's cleanup man. The one who made accidents happen." He swallowed hard. "She said he was still out there. That he would come for us eventually."

"We can talk about this later. Right now we need to—"

The floorboard behind me creaked.

I spun, reaching for my weapon, but I was too slow. Something hard cracked against the side of my head, and the world exploded into white light and pain. I crashed against the wall, my vision swimming, my weapon clattering across the floor.

A figure stood in the doorway. Average height, average build, wearing nondescript clothing—jeans, a dark jacket, work boots. His face was unremarkable, the kind of face you'd forget the moment you looked away. But his eyes were different. His eyes were empty, like holes punched in a mask.

"Detective Marlowe." His voice was flat, colorless. "Looks like this is our final encounter."

The Adjuster moved with the efficiency of someone who had done this many times before. He kicked my weapon into the corner and produced a handgun of his own—a .22 with a suppressor, the kind of gun professionals used when they wanted to be quiet about their work.

"Don't move." The words were directed at my father, who had frozen by the window. "Don't speak. Don't do anything except breathe, and do that quietly."

"Who are you?" My head was ringing, blood trickling down my temple, but I forced myself to focus. "Why are you doing this?"

"I'm a function." The Adjuster positioned himself between me and the door, the gun never wavering. "A service. When something needs to happen quietly, I make it happen. That's all anyone needs to know."

"You worked for Eleanor Ashworth."

"I work for whoever pays me. Eleanor was a good client. Consistent. Professional. She understood that some problems can't be solved with lawyers and money." He glanced at my father. "Your mother was one of those problems. Did you know that?"

It was my father who broke the silence. "What?"

"Why don't you tell your father, James." The Adjuster's lips curved into something that might have been a smile on a face that knew how to make expressions. "I'm sure you're up to speed by now."

"You're lying." My dad wore a look of disbelief. His entire world was crumbling before him. 

"Lying is inefficient for someone like me." He raised the gun slightly. "But we're not here to discuss ancient history. We're here because Sterling talked. He's next, by the way."

I shifted slightly, trying to gauge the distance to my weapon. The Adjuster noticed and shook his head.

"Don't. I've killed men who were faster than you, Detective. Younger than you. Better trained than you. You wouldn't even get your fingers around the grip before I put a bullet in your head."

"Then why are we still talking?"

The question seemed to genuinely interest him. He tilted his head, considering. "Because I like to play with my food. And you—" he gestured with the gun, "—you're interesting. You've accomplished more in days than the rest of your family has in decades. I was even rooting for you. A shame it had to come to this."

"You killed Marcus Webb. In Seattle." my father chimed in on the conversation.

"Technically." The Adjuster moved to the window, glancing out at the misty morning. "The crane accident was something that I arranged. He had to disappear."

"Is that what you're going to do to us? Make us disappear?"

"Your father, yes. A tragic accident that happens while exploring an abandoned property." His eyes flickered to me, pensive in thought. "You. You're more complicated."

"The FBI knows where I am. Agent Torres—"

"I know all about Agent Torres. She's got her hands full right now with a bomb threat." The Adjuster smiled again, that empty, mechanical expression. "While Torres and her team are evacuating, I'm here. By the time anyone realizes the bomb was a decoy, you and your father will be exactly where I need you to be."

My father spoke for the first time since the Adjuster appeared. His voice was steady, stronger than I expected.

"You're not going to win."

The Adjuster turned to him, eyebrows raised slightly. "I'm sorry?"

"You think you're untouchable. You think you've been doing this for so long that you've become invisible. But Eleanor thought the same thing." My father took a step forward, despite the gun pointed at him. "She spent sixty years building her empire, destroying everyone who got in her way. And now she's dead. Killed by her own family, in her own house, because she pushed too many people too far."

"Eleanor made mistakes that day. She let herself bleed. Her baby sharks could smell the blood."

"You made a mistake coming here." My father's eyes were fierce now, alive with something I'd never seen in him before. "You're in Marcus Webb's house. The man you helped murder. The man whose memory has haunted this family for sixty years. And you think you're just going to walk away?"

"Cool story." the Adjuster interrupted, sparing a quick glance at his weapon, then looking around while making mental calculations. "I think we're about done here."

Robert shook his head. "Not this time."

I saw it before the Adjuster did—my father's hand moving to his pocket, pulling something out. A flare gun. Old, probably from a maritime emergency kit, but functional.

The Adjuster reacted instantly, bringing his weapon up—

I lunged at him, wedging myself between my dad and the threat. The .22 went off, the suppressed shot like a loud cough, and something more than a graze tore through my side. The bullet punched through flesh and muscle just below my ribs, a searing agony that stole my breath. But I was already crashing into him, driving him backward into the hallway. We hit the wall hard, his gun spinning away, and then we were grappling, my hands around his throat, his fingers clawing at my face.

He was stronger than he looked. Wiry, compact, every muscle trained for this kind of close-quarters violence. An elbow caught me in the solar plexus and I gasped, loosening my grip just enough for him to slip free. A knee came up toward my groin—I twisted, took it on my thigh instead, and threw a punch that connected with his jaw.

He staggered but didn't go down. Blood was pouring from my side now, hot and thick, each heartbeat sending fresh waves of agony through my body. I could feel my strength draining, my movements becoming sluggish, but I couldn't stop. Couldn't let him get to his weapon, couldn't give him room to operate.

"James!"

My father's voice. I turned—and the Adjuster's fist caught me in the temple, exactly where he'd hit me before. The world went sideways, my legs buckled, and I crashed to the floor.

The Adjuster stood over me, breathing hard, blood on his lip. He reached for his fallen weapon—

The flare gun went off.

A brilliant red light filled the hallway, and the Adjuster screamed as the burning phosphorus caught him in the chest. He stumbled backward, flames spreading across his jacket, clawing at the fire that consumed him. His foot caught the broken railing of the staircase and he pitched backward into the darkness below.

I heard him fall. Heard the impacts as his body struck the stairs, tumbling, crashing.

My father helped me crawl to the top of the stairs. The Adjuster lay at the bottom of the stairs, motionless, his chest still smoldering.

Robert was already on his phone, dialing 911. I leaned against the wall, my head spinning, and watched the morning light filter through the dusty windows of Marcus Webb's childhood home.

I tried to stand, but my legs wouldn't cooperate. The wound in my side was worse than I'd thought—the bullet had done real damage, not just a graze. I could feel my consciousness beginning to slip, the edges of my vision going dark.

"James. James, stay with me." My father was pressing something against my wound—his jacket, I realized—applying pressure. "Stay awake. You're going to be okay."

But I wasn't sure I believed him. We put a stop to the Adjuster. But now his bullet was inside me, a piece of him I would carry forever.

"The box," I managed. "Get the box..."

My father reluctantly left me after remembering the original reason he was in this house. I lay on the dusty floor of Marcus Webb's childhood home, bleeding, staring up into nothing, lost in thought.

Sixty years ago, a young man had walked out of this house and never come back. He'd fallen in love, been betrayed, and died in a shipping yard three thousand miles away. His only crime had been loving the wrong woman—or rather, being loved by the right one, in a world where Eleanor Ashworth decided what was right and wrong.

But the secrets he'd left behind had survived. His sister. His letters. His children and grandchildren, carrying his blood through the decades without even knowing it. And now, finally, the man who'd helped kill him was lying at the bottom of Marcus Webb's stairs, brought down in Marcus Webb's house.

The morning light filtered through the dusty windows, and I felt the cold seeping into my bones. Whether from blood loss or something else, I couldn't tell.

The paramedics arrived first, followed by state troopers and eventually Agent Torres herself.

"James—"

"I'm fine. The Adjuster is downstairs. He might still be alive."

She turned to her team, barking orders.

"There's nobody down here," one of her men responded. "The railing is broken, and we see some burn marks on the wood, but—"

"What!" I yelled, instantly regretting my sudden jerking motion. I winced in pain, whispering with tears in my eyes. "He was down there a moment ago."

She turned to one of her agents. "Sweep the entire property. Every room, every closet, the basement, the grounds. I want forensics on that staircase."

Agent Torres continued to delegate while the paramedics worked on stabilizing me. The bullet had done more damage than anyone wanted to admit—it had nicked an artery, they said, and I'd lost too much blood. They were talking about surgery, about transfusions, about the long road to recovery.

My father appeared at my side, his face drawn with worry. "James. They need to take you now. The helicopter is waiting."

Helicopter. That's how serious it was.

"Dad." I reached for his hand, and he took it. "The Adjuster is still out there. He's not done."

"I know."

"He'll come back. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But he'll come back."

My father squeezed my hand. "Then we'll just have to be ready for him."

The paramedics were lifting my stretcher now, carrying me toward the waiting helicopter. The morning sun was fully up, burning away the mist, revealing the old Webb property in all its decayed glory. A house of secrets. A house of ghosts.

---

The surgery took four hours. The bullet had done significant damage—torn through muscle, nicked the hepatic artery, lodged itself against my lower rib. The doctors removed it, piece by piece, and stitched me back together as best they could.

But they warned me that some things couldn't be fixed. Nerve damage. Scar tissue. The bullet's path had carved a permanent channel through my body, a reminder that would ache every time the weather changed, every time I moved wrong, every time I remembered the Adjuster's empty eyes staring down at me in Marcus Webb's hallway.

I would carry that bullet wound for the rest of my life. A souvenir from my brush with death, from facing a man who made people disappear and then disappeared himself.

When I woke in the recovery room, my father was there. So was Rebecca. They sat on opposite sides of my bed like mismatched bookends. Agent Torres entered the room on cue, as if she'd known the exact moment I would wake. She confirmed I could hear her before she picked up where we had left off. How long had I been unconscious?

"The forensics team found nothing," Agent Torres said quietly. "No body. No fingerprints. No evidence that anyone fell down those stairs."

I nodded. I'd expected as much.

"We've issued an alert for the Adjuster, but without a name, a face, anything concrete..." She trailed off. "He could be anywhere."

"He's still out there." I touched my bandaged side, feeling the layers of gauze and tape, the dull throb of pain beneath the morphine. "And he won't stop until he finishes what he started."

"Fine by me." Rebecca's voice was steel. "Because now we have everything, including Sterling's testimony."

Things began to click together in my head. Sterling was the informant. A memory jumped to the front of my mind. The Adjuster saying something vital. That David Sterling was next on his list.

"Rebecca," I interrupted. "About Sterling. We need to bring him somewhere safe. The Adjuster said he would be next." 

The mask of Agent Torres, usually calm and tempered, cracked for a brief moment. She rushed out the room, presumibly to make important calls that placed a certain attorney under the appropriate protections. Time was of essence and had unintentionally held back a key piece of information. I hoped it didn't cost David Sterling his life. 

The whole time my father watched as I processed a slew of emotions. At first he was quiet, his hand still holding mine. But then, finally, he spoke.

"James. When you're recovered... there's a lot we need to talk about."

I looked at him—really looked at him, for the first time in years. "Yeah. There is."

"About your grandmother. About Marcus." He paused. "There was something important in that box. Something you should know about."

"We will." I squeezed his hand, feeling the roughness of his palm, the strength still in his grip. "But first think I need sleep."

They let me sleep. And when I closed my eyes, I saw the Adjuster falling, burning, disappearing into nothing. A man who had killed without consequence for sixty years, finally facing a reckoning—and slipping away from it like smoke through fingers.

He was still out there. I knew it in my bones, in the wound that would scar, in the ache that would never fully fade. The Adjuster was still out there, and someday, he would return to finish the job.

---

I awoke to a chaotic scene. My father and great-aunt were gesticulating to Agent Torres in what seemed like an argument. Their voices adjusting from a distant muzzled sound to clear, crisp words. They were talking about David Sterling.

"Is David Sterling alive?" I interrupted their spat.

The three shared dejected looks, confirming my answer. This was a huge blow to the case. David was Rebecca's informant, and without him everything else would begin to fall apart. It had to be the adjuster. When would he come for me? I wasn't ready. I needed time to recover. To prepare. But I was still nervous knowing that no amount of time would bring me back to one-hundred percent. I didn't know if I had it in me to face him again.

"James!" my dad shook me, snapping me out of a trance. I was spiraling.

"He didn't just get away," I announced, overtaken by a sense of dread. "he crippled our case. Crippled me."

It was Agent Torres who spoke this time. "As much as I feel for you, James, this is no time for a pity party."

She was right. That was just the kick in the behind that I needed to properly wake up. My mind went back into detective mode.

"How do we pick the case back up?" I asked.

"David Sterling wasn't the only one acting from the shadows." Agent Torres answered, ready for my question. "It's time we pulled down all the branches of this wrotten tree."

"With what resources?" My skepticism still wasn't fully addressed. "The FBI isn't going to fund a witch hunt, and we've got powerful forces working against us."

"About that–" my dad interjected. "I think it's time I told you about what your grandfather left in the box."

Catherine smiled as Robert presented a thick stack of papers to me, crease marks on each side like they were folded to fit in an envelope. As I sifted through these documents I came to an abrupt conclusion. This was a will. No. It was an inheritance.
