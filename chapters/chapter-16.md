# Marcus Webb's Legacy

The old Webb property sat at the end of a gravel road that hadn't seen maintenance in decades. Weeds had consumed the ditches on either side, and the morning mist hung low over the fields, turning the world into something gauzy and uncertain. I killed my headlights a quarter mile out and let the car coast to a stop behind a stand of overgrown honeysuckle.

The house emerged from the fog like a memory refusing to fade. Two stories of weathered clapboard, the white paint long since surrendered to gray. A wraparound porch that sagged in the middle. Windows that stared out at the world like empty eye sockets. This was where Marcus Webb had grown up, before Eleanor Ashworth had noticed him, desired him, and ultimately destroyed him.

My father's truck was parked in the circular drive. No other vehicles that I could see—but the adjuster wouldn't announce himself with something as careless as a car in plain sight.

I drew my weapon and moved through the tall grass, staying low, watching the windows for any sign of movement. The morning was silent except for the distant call of crows and the soft crunch of my footsteps. Every shadow could be a threat. Every rustle of wind through the dead leaves sounded like someone breathing.

The front door hung open. Not broken—just open, as if someone had walked through and not bothered to close it behind them.

I stepped onto the porch, wincing at the creak of the boards. Inside, the house smelled like dust and decay, old wallpaper and older secrets. A staircase led up to the second floor, its banister thick with grime. To my right, what had once been a parlor sat empty except for a single chair, positioned to face the window that looked out over the road.

Someone had been watching. Waiting.

"Dad?" I kept my voice low. "Robert?"

No answer. I moved through the parlor into a narrow hallway. Photographs still hung on the walls—faded images of people I didn't recognize. A young couple on their wedding day. Children in Sunday clothes. A family gathered around a Christmas tree.

And there, near the end of the hall, a photograph I did recognize. Marcus Webb, young and handsome, standing in front of a shipping yard with a lunchbox in his hand. The same face I'd seen in Catherine's photographs. The same face that had been erased from history by Eleanor Ashworth.

A sound from above. Footsteps, slow and deliberate.

I took the stairs two at a time, my weapon leading the way. At the top, a narrow landing split into two corridors. The footsteps had come from the left—from what looked like a bedroom at the end of the hall.

The door was closed. I pressed my back against the wall beside it, steadied my breathing.

"Millbrook Police. Come out with your hands visible."

Silence. Then, from behind the door, my father's voice: "James? Is that you?"

Relief flooded through me, followed immediately by renewed caution. "Are you alone?"

"I—I think so. I thought I heard someone downstairs earlier, but—"

"I'm coming in. Stay where you are."

I turned the knob and pushed the door open, sweeping the room with my weapon. My father stood near the window, a cardboard box at his feet. He looked older than he had at the cemetery—grayer, more fragile. But he was alive.

"Thank God." I holstered my weapon. "We need to get you out of here. Now."

"James, what's going on? I found what Catherine sent me for—it's in the box—but then I heard sounds downstairs and—"

"There's no time to explain." I crossed to him, grabbed his arm. "Someone dangerous is coming. Someone who's been eliminating witnesses connected to the Webb family."

My father's face went pale. "The adjuster?"

I stopped. "You know about the adjuster?"

"Catherine told me. Stories from the old days—Eleanor's cleanup man. The one who made accidents happen." He swallowed hard. "She said he was still out there. That he would come for us eventually."

"He's here. In Millbrook. And Margaret—Agent Torres—says you're his first target."

My father didn't move. "Margaret called you?"

"She's been protecting us. All of us. She's your—" I stopped, realizing how much my father still didn't know. How much none of us had known. "She's your sister, Dad. Your mother's second child. The one she gave away to protect her from Eleanor."

The revelation hit my father like a physical blow. He staggered back, gripping the windowsill for support. "I have a sister?"

"We can talk about this later. Right now we need to—"

The floorboard behind me creaked.

I spun, reaching for my weapon, but I was too slow. Something hard cracked against the side of my head, and the world exploded into white light and pain. I crashed against the wall, my vision swimming, my weapon clattering across the floor.

A figure stood in the doorway. Average height, average build, wearing nondescript clothing—jeans, a dark jacket, work boots. His face was unremarkable, the kind of face you'd forget the moment you looked away. But his eyes were different. His eyes were empty, like holes punched in a mask.

"Detective Marlowe." His voice was flat, colorless. "I was wondering how long it would take you to get here."

---

The adjuster moved with the efficiency of someone who had done this many times before. He kicked my weapon into the corner and produced a handgun of his own—a .22 with a suppressor, the kind of gun professionals used when they wanted to be quiet about their work.

"Don't move." The words were directed at my father, who had frozen by the window. "Don't speak. Don't do anything except breathe, and do that quietly."

"Who are you?" My head was ringing, blood trickling down my temple, but I forced myself to focus. "What's your real name?"

"Names are for people who matter." The adjuster positioned himself between me and the door, the gun never wavering. "I'm a function. A service. When something needs to happen quietly, I make it happen. That's all anyone needs to know."

"You worked for Eleanor Ashworth."

"I work for whoever pays me. Eleanor was a good client. Consistent. Professional. She understood that some problems can't be solved with lawyers and money." He glanced at my father. "Your grandmother was supposed to be one of those problems. Did you know that?"

My blood ran cold. "What?"

"After she confronted Eleanor—after the locket incident—Eleanor called me. She wanted it handled. Made to look natural." The adjuster's lips curved into something that might have been a smile on a face that knew how to make expressions. "But then your grandmother died on her own. Heart attack, three days later. Saved me the trouble."

"You're lying."

"I never lie. It's inefficient." He raised the gun slightly. "But we're not here to discuss ancient history. We're here because Sterling talked before your people picked him up. He told the network everything—the FBI operation, the evidence, the witnesses. And now certain people want certain loose ends eliminated before tomorrow night."

"The operation is compromised?"

"The operation is irrelevant. Half the network is already gone—Morrison, Caldwell, Judge Harper. The smart ones are running. The stubborn ones are preparing to fight. But none of that matters to me. I'm being paid to clean up the Webb family connection. You, your father, Catherine Webb, Rosa Martinez. Everyone who can tie the old crimes to the new ones."

I shifted slightly, trying to gauge the distance to my weapon. The adjuster noticed and shook his head.

"Don't. I've killed men who were faster than you, Detective. Younger than you. Better trained than you. You wouldn't even get your fingers around the grip before I put a bullet in your father's head."

"Then why are we still talking?"

The question seemed to genuinely interest him. He tilted his head, considering. "Because I like to understand the people I kill. It makes the work more meaningful. And you—" he gestured with the gun, "—you're interesting. You've been chasing Eleanor's shadow for days, digging up secrets that were buried before you were born. And now you're standing in the house where Marcus Webb grew up, about to die in the same room where he took his first steps."

"You killed Marcus Webb. In Seattle."

"I arranged his death. There's a difference." The adjuster moved to the window, glancing out at the misty morning. "The crane accident was elegant. Plausible. The kind of thing that gets ruled industrial negligence and forgotten about. That's the art of what I do, Detective. Not just killing—anyone can kill. But making it disappear. Making it mean nothing. That's skill."

"Is that what you're going to do to us? Make us disappear?"

"Your father, yes. A tragic accident while exploring an abandoned property—falls through rotten floorboards, breaks his neck. You're more complicated. A detective shot with his own weapon during an altercation with an unknown suspect. I'll stage it properly—make it look like you were investigating a burglary call and surprised someone."

"The FBI knows where I am. Agent Torres—"

"Agent Torres is Margaret Webb, your father's secret sister, and she's currently dealing with a bomb threat at the Millbrook FBI field office." The adjuster smiled again, that empty, mechanical expression. "The network may be dying, Detective, but it still has resources. While Torres and her team are evacuating, I'm here. By the time anyone realizes the bomb was a decoy, you and your father will be exactly where I need you to be."

My father spoke for the first time since the adjuster appeared. His voice was steady, stronger than I expected.

"You're not going to win."

The adjuster turned to him, eyebrows raised slightly. "I'm sorry?"

"You think you're untouchable. You think you've been doing this for so long that you've become invisible. But Eleanor thought the same thing." My father took a step forward, despite the gun pointed at him. "She spent sixty years building her empire, destroying everyone who got in her way. And now she's dead—killed by her own family, in her own house, because she pushed too many people too far."

"Eleanor made mistakes. I don't."

"You made a mistake coming here." My father's eyes were fierce now, alive with something I'd never seen in him before. "You're in Marcus Webb's house. The man you helped murder. The man whose memory has haunted this family for sixty years. And you think you're just going to walk away?"

"I know I'm going to walk away. I always walk away."

My father shook his head. "Not this time."

I saw it before the adjuster did—my father's hand moving to his pocket, pulling something out. A flare gun. Old, probably from a maritime emergency kit, but functional.

The adjuster reacted instantly, bringing his weapon around—

I launched myself at him. The .22 went off, the suppressed shot like a loud cough, and something burned along my ribs. But I was already crashing into him, driving him backward into the hallway. We hit the wall hard, his gun spinning away, and then we were grappling, my hands around his throat, his fingers clawing at my face.

He was stronger than he looked. Wiry, compact, every muscle trained for this kind of close-quarters violence. An elbow caught me in the solar plexus and I gasped, loosening my grip just enough for him to slip free. A knee came up toward my groin—I twisted, took it on my thigh instead, and threw a punch that connected with his jaw.

He staggered but didn't go down. Blood was running down my side now, the bullet graze burning like fire, but I couldn't stop. Couldn't let him get to his weapon, couldn't give him room to operate.

"James!"

My father's voice. I turned—and the adjuster's fist caught me in the temple, exactly where he'd hit me before. The world went sideways, my legs buckled, and I crashed to the floor.

The adjuster stood over me, breathing hard, blood on his lip. He reached for his fallen weapon—

The flare gun went off.

A brilliant red light filled the hallway, and the adjuster screamed as the burning phosphorus caught him in the chest. He stumbled backward, flames spreading across his jacket, and crashed through the railing of the staircase.

I heard him fall. Heard the impact below. And then, for a long moment, I heard nothing at all.

---

My father helped me to the window. The adjuster lay at the bottom of the stairs, motionless, his chest still smoldering. I couldn't tell if he was dead or unconscious, but either way, he wasn't getting up anytime soon.

"We need to call for backup." My voice came out as a croak. "And an ambulance."

"The bullet—"

"Just grazed me. I'll live." I pressed my hand against my ribs, feeling the warm wetness seeping through my shirt. "But we need to secure him before he wakes up."

My father was already on his phone, dialing 911. I leaned against the wall, my head spinning, and watched the morning light filter through the dusty windows of Marcus Webb's childhood home.

Sixty years ago, a young man had walked out of this house and never come back. He'd fallen in love, been betrayed, and died in a shipping yard three thousand miles away. His only crime had been loving the wrong woman—or rather, being loved by the right one, in a world where Eleanor Ashworth decided what was right and wrong.

But the secrets he'd left behind had survived. His sister. His letters. His children and grandchildren, carrying his blood through the decades without even knowing it. And now, finally, the man who'd helped kill him was lying at the bottom of Marcus Webb's stairs, brought down in Marcus Webb's house.

There was a poetry to it that I couldn't quite articulate.

"James." My father's hand on my shoulder, steadying me. "Help is on the way. Just stay awake."

"I'm awake." I looked at him—really looked at him, for the first time in years. "Dad. The box you came here for. What's in it?"

He was quiet for a moment. Then he walked back into the bedroom and returned with the cardboard box, setting it on the floor beside me.

"Catherine told me where to find it. Marcus hid it here before he left for Seattle—insurance, in case anything happened to him." My father opened the box carefully. "He knew, James. Even then, he knew Eleanor might come for him. So he left proof."

Inside were documents. Old, yellowed, fragile—but legible. Employment records from Ashworth Shipping. Financial documents showing payments to shell companies. Photographs of meetings between Eleanor and men in expensive suits. And at the bottom, a leather journal with Marcus Webb's name embossed on the cover.

"His diary," my father said. "Everything he saw, everything he suspected. Names, dates, amounts. Fifty years of corruption, all written down by a shipping clerk who knew he might not survive."

I picked up the journal carefully. The pages were filled with neat, careful handwriting—the penmanship of a man who understood that words mattered, that what was written down could outlast the person who wrote it.

"This is what Sterling was afraid of," I said. "This is why Eleanor had Marcus killed. Not just because he loved grandmother—because he knew too much."

"He was going to expose her. That's what Catherine told me. Marcus was gathering evidence, building a case. He was going to take it to the authorities." My father's voice was thick. "But Eleanor found out before he could finish. She had him transferred to Seattle, and then—"

"And then she had him killed." I closed my eyes. "Sixty years ago. And the evidence he gathered has been sitting in this house ever since."

"Waiting for someone to find it."

Sirens in the distance. Help was coming. But I couldn't move yet, couldn't stop looking at the journal in my hands. Marcus Webb's journal. My great-grandfather's journal.

The man Eleanor Ashworth had erased from history had left behind everything they needed to destroy her legacy.

---

The paramedics arrived first, followed by state troopers and eventually Agent Torres herself. Margaret rushed in like a woman possessed, her professional composure cracking when she saw me sitting against the wall, blood soaking through my shirt.

"James—"

"I'm fine. The adjuster is downstairs. He might still be alive."

She turned to her team, barking orders, and I watched as they secured the scene. The adjuster was indeed alive—barely. Third-degree burns across his chest and a possible spinal injury from the fall. They loaded him onto a stretcher and took him away, and I felt something release in my chest. A tension I hadn't even known I was carrying.

"The warehouse operation," I said, when Margaret returned to my side. "Sterling talked. They know you're coming."

"I know. The bomb threat at the field office was designed to pull me away from you." Her jaw was tight with anger. "I should have anticipated—"

"You can't anticipate everything." I gestured toward the cardboard box. "But look what we found."

Margaret opened the box. I watched her face as she paged through Marcus's journal, saw the emotions flicker across her features—anger, grief, vindication. She was reading her father's words for the first time. The father she'd never known, the man who'd been killed before she was even born.

"This changes everything," she said quietly. "This isn't just testimony. This isn't just documents we recovered from Sterling or Eleanor's files. This is primary source evidence, written in real-time by a witness who was murdered to keep him quiet."

"Marcus knew he was being watched. He wrote it all down because he knew he might not survive to testify."

"And he hid it here, in his childhood home, where no one would think to look." Margaret closed the journal and held it against her chest. "Our father was a smart man."

"He was. And so was grandmother. She kept his letter. She kept the locket. She made sure the truth would survive, even if she didn't."

My father appeared in the doorway, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. The paramedics had wanted to check him out, but he'd refused to leave until I was stable.

"James. They're ready to take you to the hospital."

"In a minute." I looked at Margaret—at the aunt I'd just met, the sister my father had never known. "The warehouse operation. What's the plan now?"

"We adapt." Margaret's voice was steel. "The network knows we're coming. Fine. Let them know. Because now we have Marcus's journal. We have Sterling's testimony. We have Eleanor's files, Morrison's records, the kill list, the payment trails. We have sixty years of evidence, and none of their remaining operatives can change that."

"They'll try to run."

"Some will. We'll catch them. And the ones who try to fight—" Margaret smiled, and there was something fierce in it, something that reminded me of the fire in my father's eyes when he'd faced down the adjuster. "—they'll learn that the Webb family doesn't go down easy."

The paramedics were getting impatient. I let them help me onto the stretcher, wincing as they stabilized my ribs. But before they carried me out, I reached for my father's hand.

"Dad. Come with me to the hospital."

He looked surprised. In all the years of distance between us, I'd never asked him for anything. Never reached out, never opened the door.

"The case—"

"Can wait a few hours." I held his hand, feeling the roughness of his palm, the strength still in his grip. "We have a lot to talk about. About grandmother. About Marcus. About Margaret." I paused. "About everything we should have talked about years ago."

My father's eyes were bright with tears. He nodded, once, and didn't let go of my hand.

"Okay, James. Okay."

---

THEREFORE the adjuster was captured, but the war wasn't over. As the ambulance carried me away from Marcus Webb's house, I knew that the network was still out there—wounded, exposed, but dangerous. And somewhere in Millbrook, the remaining members were deciding whether to run, fight, or surrender.

But for the first time in this investigation, I felt something other than dread. I felt hope. Not for myself, not even for the case—but for the family I was finally starting to understand.

Sixty years ago, Marcus Webb had written in his journal that the truth never dies. It waits. It finds a way.

He was right.

The truth had been waiting in that old house, patient and quiet, for someone to finally come looking. And now that we'd found it, nothing could bury it again.
