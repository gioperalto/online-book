# Midnight Confessions

The hours between dusk and midnight crawled like wounded things. I drove back to my apartment to shower, change, and pretend I was the kind of man who could eat dinner when his world was tilting on its axis. The bourbon on my kitchen table remained untouched. The photograph remained face-down. Some routines are just habits; others are armor.

I arrived at the old Ashworth chapel at eleven-forty, twenty minutes early because that's how you survive in this business. You get there first. You watch. You wait.

The chapel sat at the far edge of the Ashworth property, separated from the main estate by a quarter mile of overgrown forest and a rusted iron gate that hadn't been locked in decades. It was a Gothic relic, all pointed arches and crumbling stone, its stained glass windows long since shattered by time and teenage vandals. The Ashworths had built it in the 1890s, back when the family still believed in something beyond money and power. Now it was just another monument to their decay.

I parked my car on the access road and walked the last hundred yards on foot, my flashlight cutting a weak beam through the darkness. The rain had stopped, but the clouds still hung low and heavy, blocking out the moon and stars. The only sounds were my footsteps crunching on dead leaves and the distant hoot of an owl. Mournful. Questioning.

The chapel door hung askew on rusted hinges. I pushed it open, wincing at the groan of tortured metal, and stepped inside.

The interior was exactly what you'd expect from a building abandoned for half a century. Pews overturned and rotting. Hymnals scattered across the floor, their pages swollen with moisture and mold. At the far end, a stone altar stood beneath what remained of a massive crucifix, Christ's face worn smooth by time until it was just a suggestion of features, a ghost of divinity.

I checked my watch. Eleven-fifty. Ten minutes until Rosa was supposed to arrive.

I found a pew that still had four legs and sat down to wait. The silence pressed against my ears like cotton, thick and suffocating. In the darkness, my mind wandered back to the last time I'd been here. Twenty-three years ago. I was a rookie cop and my grandmother was still alive. The Ashworth name was just another wealthy family in Millbrook. Not the weight around my neck it had become.

The sound of approaching footsteps pulled me back to the present. I stood, my hand instinctively moving toward the service weapon at my hip, and watched as a figure appeared in the doorway.

Rosa Martinez stepped into the chapel, wrapped in a heavy coat, a flashlight of her own clutched in one hand. She looked smaller here, away from the grand surroundings of the Ashworth estate. Just a woman in her sixties. Carrying secrets that had grown heavier with each passing year.

"Detective Marlowe." Her voice echoed off the stone walls. "You came."

"You knew I would."

She nodded slowly, picking her way through the debris toward the altar. I followed, my flashlight beam tracking her movements.

"I have worked for the Ashworths for thirty-five years," she said, not looking at me. "I started when I was twenty-eight. A young woman from Guadalajara, barely speaking English, desperate for work. Mrs. Ashworth. The old Mrs. Ashworth, Eleanor's mother-in-law. She hired me as a kitchen maid. Said she liked the way I didn't chatter."

She reached the altar and turned to face me, her dark eyes glittering in the combined light of our flashlights.

"In thirty-five years, I have seen many things. Things that would make a priest weep. Things that would make a judge vomit." Her voice was flat, matter-of-fact. "I have kept silent because that is what you do in this family. You see nothing. You hear nothing. You remember nothing."

"But now?"

"Now Eleanor is dead." Rosa's face twisted with something that might have been grief or relief. It was hard to tell in the shadows. "And I am old, Detective. Too old to carry these secrets to my grave. They are too heavy. They have been heavy for twenty years."

She reached into her coat pocket and withdrew something small that glinted gold in the flashlight beam. My breath caught in my throat.

It was a photograph. Faded, creased from years of handling, but unmistakable.

My grandmother. Young, beautiful, standing beside a man I didn't recognize in front of this very chapel. And around her neck, the gold heart-shaped locket that had been found clutched in Eleanor Ashworth's dead hand.

"Where did you get this?" My voice came out rough, broken.

Rosa didn't answer. Instead, she reached into her coat and pulled out a small wooden box, weathered with age. She set it on the altar between us.

"Your grandmother gave me this. The day before she died." Rosa's eyes met mine in the flickering light. "She said: 'When James is ready, show him the path. Don't give him the answers—give him the questions.'"

I stared at the box. "What's inside?"

"Open it."

My hands trembled as I lifted the lid. Inside, nestled in faded velvet, were three items: a newspaper clipping yellowed with age, a small brass key, and a folded piece of paper covered in my grandmother's handwriting.

I picked up the newspaper clipping first. The headline read: *SHIPPING YARD ACCIDENT CLAIMS WORKER'S LIFE - Seattle, 1964*. The photograph beneath showed a crane, collapsed, and in the background, barely visible, a young man's face circled in pencil.

"Who circled this?"

"Read the name in the article."

I scanned the faded text. *Marcus Webb, 34, a transfer from the Millbrook shipping office...*

My blood ran cold. I looked at the photograph Rosa had shown me—the man standing with my grandmother, the same strong jaw, the same eyes.

"He was transferred. And then he died."

Rosa said nothing. She simply pointed at the folded paper.

I opened it. My grandmother's handwriting—I'd recognize it anywhere—but the words made no sense at first:

*Things I Cannot Say:*
*- E. wanted what she could not have*
*- M. chose me instead*
*- Three days after I confronted her, they found me*
*- The locket was GONE when I woke in the hospital*
*- Natural causes. That is what money buys.*
*- If you're reading this, I did not survive the second attempt*

"Second attempt?" The words came out strangled.

"Look at the date on the newspaper clipping, Detective. Then look at your grandmother's death certificate. Count the years."

I did the math in my head. Thirty years. My grandmother had lived thirty years after Marcus Webb died. And then, according to her own words...

"She woke in the hospital. After the first 'heart attack.' But she wrote 'if you're reading this, I did not survive the second attempt.'"

Rosa nodded slowly. "Your grandmother was poisoned, Detective. The first time, she survived. The second time..." Her voice trailed off.

"Eleanor killed her."

"I don't give you answers. I give you questions." Rosa picked up the brass key from the box. "This opens a safe deposit box at First National Bank. Your grandmother's secrets are there—letters, documents, things she gathered over sixty years of watching and waiting." She pressed the key into my palm. "The path is yours to walk now. The truth is yours to find."

I sat in the darkness, turning the key over in my fingers. My grandmother hadn't just left me evidence—she'd left me a trail of breadcrumbs, a detective's treasure hunt spanning decades.

"Why didn't she go to the police? Why didn't she expose Eleanor while she was still alive?"

Rosa's laugh was bitter. "Ask yourself who owned the police in this town for the last sixty years. Then ask yourself why your grandmother chose to leave her evidence to a detective she trusted—her own grandson—instead of anyone else."

I looked at the key, the clipping, the handwritten list of things she couldn't say aloud. My grandmother had known she was being hunted. She'd prepared for it. And she'd waited, patiently, for someone who would finally be able to follow the trail.

"The locket," I said slowly. "She was wearing it when she confronted Eleanor. It disappeared. And now Eleanor dies clutching it. Why?"

"That's the right question." Rosa's eyes glittered. "Now find the right answer."

A sound cut through the darkness. The creak of rusted hinges. The groan of the chapel door being pushed open.

Rosa went rigid. "Someone followed us."

I was on my feet in an instant, my weapon drawn, my flashlight sweeping toward the entrance. "Who's there?"

No answer. Just the whisper of wind through broken windows and the pound of my own heartbeat.

"Stay behind me," I told Rosa, moving toward the door. My footsteps seemed impossibly loud in the silence, each one echoing off stone walls that had heard confessions for over a century.

I reached the doorway and swept my flashlight across the darkness outside. Nothing. No movement. No sound.

The blow came from behind.

I didn't see it. Didn't hear it. Just felt an explosion of pain at the base of my skull as something heavy connected with the back of my head. The world tilted sideways, my flashlight spinning away into darkness, my weapon clattering across stone.

I hit the ground hard, my vision swimming with stars and shadows. Somewhere nearby, Rosa was screaming. A high, terrified sound that cut off abruptly. Replaced by the sickening thud of a body hitting the floor.

But my body wouldn't obey. The darkness was closing in, thick and suffocating, and the last thing I heard before unconsciousness claimed me was a voice. Familiar, yet somehow wrong. Whispering words I couldn't quite understand.

---

I woke to pain.

It radiated from the back of my skull in waves, each pulse bringing fresh nausea and a reminder that I was very much still alive. Though probably not for much longer, given the circumstances.

I was lying on cold stone, my hands bound behind my back with what felt like zip ties, my ankles similarly secured. The darkness was absolute; either my flashlight had been taken or my eyes weren't working properly. Maybe both.

"Rosa?" My voice came out as a croak. "Rosa, are you there?"

No answer.

I twisted against my bonds, testing their strength, and was rewarded with a fresh spike of pain through my skull that made my vision white out. When it cleared. Assuming my vision had cleared. It was impossible to tell in the darkness. I forced myself to take stock.

I was still in the chapel. I could smell the mold and decay, feel the grit of centuries-old dust beneath my cheek. My weapon was gone, along with my phone and flashlight. Whoever had attacked us was thorough.

The attack had come from inside the chapel, not outside. That meant our attacker had been waiting for us, had known we were coming. But how? I hadn't told anyone about Rosa's invitation. Had she?

Or had someone been watching the whole time? Listening? Following?

A sound cut through my thoughts. Footsteps. Slow and deliberate. Approaching from somewhere to my left. I went still, feigning unconsciousness, and listened.

"I know you're awake, Detective Marlowe." The voice was distorted somehow, artificially deepened, but there was something familiar about it that I couldn't quite place. "You can stop pretending."

I didn't move. Didn't speak. Let them think I was still out, let them get closer.

A foot connected with my ribs. Hard enough to drive the breath from my lungs but not hard enough to break anything. A warning shot.

"I said stop pretending." The voice was closer now, directly above me. "We need to talk."

I opened my eyes. Not that it made any difference in the darkness. I spoke through gritted teeth. "Where's Rosa?"

"The housekeeper is resting. She won't be disturbed."

My blood ran cold. "If you've hurt her."

"She's alive. For now. Her continued survival depends entirely on you, Detective. On how cooperative you choose to be."

I heard the scrape of a match, and suddenly there was light. A candle, held in a gloved hand. Illuminating nothing but shadows and the suggestion of a face hidden behind a black mask.

"Who are you?"

"That's not the right question." The figure set the candle on a nearby surface. The altar, I realized. Then crouched down to my level. "The right question is: what do you know?"

"I know Eleanor Ashworth was murdered. I know someone in that house killed her. And I know."

"You know about the locket." The masked figure leaned closer. "Rosa told you the story. The tragic romance, the jealous matriarch, the convenient accidents. She told you your grandmother was murdered."

"Was she wrong?"

A pause. Then, quietly: "No. She wasn't wrong."

Something in the voice shifted. A crack in the artificial distortion. A hint of genuine emotion beneath the mask.

"Eleanor Ashworth destroyed many people over the years," the figure continued. "Your grandmother was just one of them. Marcus Webb was another. There were others. So many others. People who got in her way. Who knew too much. Who simply existed in a space Eleanor wanted to occupy."

"So you killed her." It wasn't a question. "You poisoned her, strangled her, stabbed her. Made sure she was dead three times over."

"Justice," the figure said. "Thirty years overdue, but justice nonetheless."

"There's no justice in murder."

"No?" The figure laughed. A hollow, bitter sound. "Tell that to your grandmother. Tell that to Marcus Webb. Tell that to Margot Ashworth, who had her soul carved out by her mother's cruelty. Tell that to every person Eleanor destroyed while the world looked the other way because she had money and power and the right last name."

I struggled against my bonds, feeling the zip ties bite into my wrists. "So what now? You kill me too? Add another body to your count?"

"That depends." The figure stood, their shadow stretching across the stone floor like a specter. "I didn't intend for you to become involved, Detective. Your assignment to this case was unfortunate. But now that you know the truth—or part of it—we find ourselves at an impasse."

"An impasse."

"You have two choices. You can continue your investigation, pursue this case to its conclusion, and eventually discover who I am. In that scenario, I will be forced to protect myself. You. And everyone you care about. Will suffer the consequences." The figure paused. "Or you can walk away. Resign from the case, cite personal conflict of interest, and let the Ashworth family secrets stay buried where they belong."

"You're asking me to let a murderer go free."

"I'm asking you to understand that sometimes justice doesn't look like handcuffs and courtrooms. Sometimes it looks like a monster getting what she deserved."

I thought about my grandmother. About the locket. About thirty years of lies and convenient accidents and a family that had destroyed everyone who got too close.

Then I thought about Rosa, unconscious somewhere in this darkness. About the oath I'd taken when I pinned on my badge. About the kind of man I'd promised myself I would be, even when the world made it hard.

"No."

The word hung in the air between us, heavy with consequence.

"I won't walk away," I continued. "I can't. Whatever Eleanor was, whatever she did, she deserved to face justice in a courtroom—not be executed in her own home. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works."

The figure was silent for a long moment. When they spoke again, their voice had changed—colder, harder, stripped of whatever humanity had briefly surfaced.

"I was afraid you'd say that." They retrieved the candle from the altar and began walking toward the door. "You have until dawn, Detective. When the sun rises, your time to change your mind will be over."

"Wait—" I struggled to sit up, to see anything useful. "At least tell me—the three methods. Poison, strangulation, stabbing. Was that you? All three?"

The figure paused at the threshold.

"Ask yourself why someone would need to kill Eleanor Ashworth three different ways," they said quietly. "Ask yourself what that says about the people who wanted her dead."

And then they were gone, taking the candle with them, leaving me alone in the darkness with more questions than answers and a clock ticking toward dawn.

---

It took me forty-five minutes to free myself. Forty-five minutes of twisting and pulling and rubbing my wrists raw against the rough edge of a broken pew until the zip ties finally gave way. Another ten minutes to find Rosa, unconscious but breathing, slumped against the base of the altar with a nasty bruise forming on her temple.

By the time I got her to my car and myself to a phone, it was nearly four in the morning. I called Reyes first—woke her up, told her everything, listened to her silence grow heavier with each revelation.

"You should have told me about the locket," she said finally. "Before all of this."

"I know."

"Your grandmother. Jesus, Marlowe."

"I know."

More silence. Then: "The crime scene unit is still processing the chapel. They found the photograph you mentioned, along with some other items Rosa had collected over the years. Evidence of Eleanor's activities."

"What kind of evidence?"

"Documents. Photographs. Records of payments made to various individuals over the decades—payments that coincide with suspicious accidents, sudden disappearances, careers destroyed." Reyes paused. "If even half of this is legitimate, Eleanor Ashworth was running a one-woman crime syndicate from inside that mansion."

I leaned against my car, exhaustion finally catching up to me. The sun was just beginning to lighten the eastern sky, painting the clouds in shades of pink and gold. Dawn. The deadline my mysterious attacker had given me.

"There's something else," Reyes said. "The medical examiner finished her preliminary report on Eleanor."

"And?"

"The three methods of death. They weren't all administered at the same time."

I straightened. "What do you mean?"

"The poison was in her system for at least an hour before death—a slow-acting toxin, something that would have made her groggy, disoriented. The strangulation came second, but it wasn't what killed her. The marks suggest someone started to strangle her, then stopped. And the stabbing—the letter opener—that was the actual cause of death. But here's the thing: the angle of the wound is wrong."

"Wrong how?"

"Wrong for murder," Reyes said quietly. "Right for suicide."

A chill ran through me. "You're saying Eleanor killed herself?"

"I'm saying someone poisoned her, someone else tried to strangle her, and then Eleanor—confused, dying, maybe trying to end her suffering—picked up the letter opener and finished the job herself." Reyes exhaled. "Three methods of death, Marlowe. But possibly three different hands involved. Including the victim's own."

I stood there in the growing dawn, watching the sky lighten and the shadows retreat, thinking about a woman who had destroyed so many lives finally meeting her end at the intersection of all her sins.

Three methods. Three suspects. And a mystery that had just become infinitely more complicated.

"I need to get back to the house," I said. "There's something I'm missing. Something about the timing, the methods, the way it all fits together."

"You've been awake for over twenty-four hours and someone just tried to kill you."

"I know."

"You need rest. You need to step back and—"

"I'll rest when this is over." I climbed into my car, wincing as my head protested the movement. "Send backup to the Ashworth estate. I want everyone contained. No one leaves until I get some answers."

I hung up before she could argue and started the engine. The sun was rising over Millbrook, burning away the clouds and the shadows and the comfortable darkness that had hidden so many secrets.

Time to bring them all into the light.
