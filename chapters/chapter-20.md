# The Last Webb

Catherine Webb died at 4:47 in the morning, three days after the *Detroit Free Press* story went national.

I learned about it from Margaret, who called me while I was still half-asleep in my own apartment—the first night I'd spent at home since this whole nightmare began. She didn't waste words on pleasantries.

"Catherine passed an hour ago. Hospice nurse said she went peacefully, in her sleep." A pause. "She was smiling, James. The nurse said she was smiling."

I sat up in bed, the phone pressed to my ear, and stared at the gray light filtering through my blinds. Three days. Catherine had held on just long enough to see the story break, to watch the network begin to crumble, to know that forty years of work had finally paid off.

"Does my father know?"

"I called him first. He's on his way to the hospice now." Margaret's voice softened. "She wanted to see you, at the end. She asked for you yesterday, but you were at the station giving depositions. I should have—I should have told you."

"It's fine." The words felt hollow, inadequate. I'd only known Catherine Webb for a week—less than that, really. A stranger who turned out to be family, a ghost from a past I'd never known existed. And yet her death felt like something tearing inside me. Like another thread connecting me to my grandmother, to Marcus Webb, to the truth that Eleanor had spent fifty years trying to bury.

"There's something else," Margaret said. "Catherine left instructions. A will, some letters, and—" She hesitated. "She left something specifically for you."

---

The hospice was a converted Victorian on the north side of Millbrook, all white clapboard and wide porches that tried too hard to feel welcoming. I found my father in the parking lot, standing beside his truck with his hands in his pockets and his face turned toward the winter sky.

He looked older than I remembered. Not just from the week's events, but from something deeper—the weight of generations finally settling on his shoulders. Robert Marlowe had spent his whole life carrying secrets, and now those secrets were gone. The question was what remained.

"She went easy," he said as I approached. "That's what they told me. No pain, no struggle. Just... gone."

"I heard." I stopped beside him, close enough to touch but not touching. The distance between us was still there—smaller than before, but present. "Margaret said she was smiling."

"She was." Robert's voice cracked slightly. "The nurse showed me. She looked... relieved. Like someone who'd been holding her breath for forty years and finally got to exhale."

We stood there in silence, two men who shared blood and history and precious little else. The morning was cold, the kind of cold that seeps through your coat and reminds you that winter isn't done with you yet.

"I never got to know her," I said finally. "Catherine. She was my—what? Great-aunt? I didn't even know she existed until a week ago."

"She knew about you." Robert turned to face me, and I saw tears in his eyes. "She's been watching over you for years, James. Her and Margaret both. Making sure Eleanor's people never got too close, never figured out who you really were."

"Why didn't they tell me?"

"Because knowing would have put you in danger." Robert's jaw tightened. "Eleanor was paranoid. If she'd ever suspected that you were Marcus Webb's great-grandson—that the detective investigating her crimes was blood kin to the man she'd had murdered—she would have had you killed. No question."

I thought about the file Margaret had shown me. My name on Eleanor's list, circled in red. *Watch.* Eleanor had been watching me for twenty-six years, but she'd never known the truth. She'd never realized that the man she considered a minor threat was actually the descendant of her greatest enemy.

"Catherine wanted you to have this." Robert reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small wooden box, worn smooth with age. "She gave it to me last night. Said it belonged to you now."

I took the box. It was lighter than I expected, no bigger than my palm. The wood was dark cherry, polished to a warm gleam, with a simple brass clasp holding it closed.

"What is it?"

"Open it."

---

Inside the box, nestled on a bed of faded velvet, was a ring.

Not just any ring. A man's ring, heavy gold, with a small diamond set into an ornate setting. The kind of ring men wore in another era—a statement piece, something meant to be noticed.

"That was Marcus's wedding ring," Robert said. His voice was barely above a whisper. "He gave it to Catherine for safekeeping the day before he was killed. He knew Eleanor was coming for him. He wanted to make sure some part of him survived."

I lifted the ring from the box. The gold was warm against my fingers, as if it still held some remnant of the man who'd worn it. Marcus Webb. My great-grandfather. A shipping clerk who'd fallen in love with the wrong woman and paid for it with his life.

"There's an inscription," Robert added. "Inside the band."

I tilted the ring toward the light. The engraving was small, precise, still legible after all these decades: *H.M. Forever. 1958.*

Helen Marlowe. My grandmother. The woman Marcus had loved, the woman Eleanor had tried to destroy, the woman who had carried his child in secret and raised him as another man's son.

"She never got to wear it," Robert said. "He was going to give it to her after they were married. After he came back from Seattle." His voice broke. "He never came back."

I closed my hand around the ring. The metal bit into my palm, cool edges against warm skin.

"I have the locket," I said. "Sarah gave it to me. And now this."

"The locket and the ring." Robert nodded slowly. "The two pieces they gave each other. The two pieces that survived."

For a moment, I couldn't speak. The weight of it—the history, the tragedy, the love that had endured despite everything—pressed down on me like a physical force.

"What do I do with them?" I asked finally. "Keep them? Put them in a museum? I don't even—"

"You wear them." Robert's voice was firm now, certain. "You wear the ring, the same way Marcus would have. You keep the locket close. And you remember." He reached out and gripped my shoulder—the second time in a week he'd touched me. "That's what Catherine wanted. That's what your grandmother wanted. Not vengeance. Not justice. Just... remembrance."

The funeral was held three days later, in a small cemetery on the outskirts of Millbrook.

It wasn't where I'd expected Catherine Webb to be buried. She'd spent forty years in Seattle, building her case against Eleanor, waiting for the moment when the truth could finally be told. But her will had been explicit: she wanted to be buried in Millbrook, in the family plot where Marcus Webb's name was inscribed on a cenotaph—a memorial stone for a body that had never been recovered from Seattle.

The crowd was smaller than I'd anticipated. Margaret was there, of course, standing beside the grave with an expression that gave nothing away. My father stood on my other side, his face weathered by wind and grief. Rosa Martinez had been released from the hospital in time to attend, moving slowly with a cane but refusing the wheelchair the nurses had offered.

And Sarah was there.

I'd seen her only once since her confession at the chapel—a brief meeting at the FBI field office where she'd signed her formal statement and been processed for the charges she'd agreed to face. Obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence, failure to report a crime. The prosecutor had recommended probation rather than jail time, citing her cooperation and the exceptional circumstances of the case.

She stood at the back of the small gathering, her dark coat buttoned against the December wind, her face pale but composed. When our eyes met, she didn't look away. Neither did I.

The minister spoke words I barely heard. Something about peace, about rest, about the promise of reunion. Catherine Webb had been Catholic, apparently—another detail I'd never known, another piece of a life that had intersected with mine for such a brief moment before being extinguished.

When the casket was lowered into the ground, my father wept openly. So did Rosa. Margaret stood rigid, her jaw clenched, but I could see the moisture gathering in the corners of her eyes.

I didn't cry. I'd used up my tears days ago, in the chapel with Sarah, in the hospital with my father, in the quiet moments alone when no one was watching. Now there was only a hollow emptiness—not grief, exactly, but something adjacent to it. The feeling of a door closing. Of a chapter ending.

The minister finished his prayers. People began to drift away, stopping to offer condolences to Margaret, to murmur words of comfort that meant nothing and everything at the same time.

I stayed by the grave.

"She would have liked you."

I turned. Margaret stood beside me, her hands clasped in front of her, her eyes fixed on the freshly turned earth.

"Catherine," she continued. "I told her about you, over the years. What cases you were working, how you handled yourself. She said you had Marcus's stubbornness and Helen's integrity." A ghost of a smile crossed her face. "She said that was a dangerous combination."

"She wasn't wrong."

"No." Margaret was quiet for a moment. "I spent thirty years building a case against Eleanor Ashworth. Infiltrating her network, gathering evidence, waiting for the right moment to strike. And in the end, it was you who brought her down. Not me. Not Catherine. Not the FBI. A detective from Millbrook who didn't even know he was part of the family."

"I had help."

"You had resources. It's not the same thing." Margaret turned to face me fully. "Catherine left you more than the ring, James. There's a letter—several letters, actually. Instructions for what she wanted done with the evidence she'd gathered over forty years."

"What kind of instructions?"

"She wanted the full story published. Not just the *Detroit Free Press* article—that was just the opening salvo. She spent the last decade writing a book. A complete history of Eleanor Ashworth's crimes, from Marcus Webb's murder to the present day." Margaret's voice was carefully neutral. "She wanted you to be the one to release it."

I stared at her. "Me? Why?"

"Because you're a Marlowe and a Webb. Because you're the detective who cracked the case. Because—" Margaret hesitated. "Because she believed the story would mean more coming from family than from a stranger."

"I'm not a writer."

"You don't have to be. The book is finished—Catherine completed it six months ago, when she first learned the cancer was terminal. All you have to do is sign off on it. Write a forward, maybe. Give interviews when it's published." Margaret's eyes met mine. "Say no if you want to. I can release it through the FBI as part of the public record. But Catherine's dying wish was for you to be the one who tells the world what really happened."

After the funeral, I drove to the cemetery where my grandmother was buried.

It wasn't far—just across town, in the older section where the stones dated back to the 1800s and the trees had grown so large their roots disturbed the graves. I'd been here once before, as a child, when my father had brought me to lay flowers on her grave. I barely remembered it. A gray day, rain threatening, my father's face tight with an emotion I was too young to understand.

Her headstone was simple. *Helen Marlowe, 1930-1994. Beloved Mother and Grandmother.* No mention of Marcus Webb, of course. No hint of the secrets she'd carried to her grave.

I knelt on the cold ground and placed the ring beside the stone.

"I found him," I said. The words felt strange, speaking to earth and granite. "Your Marcus. Or what was left of him, anyway. His sister, his letters, his ring. The truth."

The wind whispered through the bare branches above me. Somewhere in the distance, a car horn honked.

"I don't know if you can hear me. I don't know if there's anything after—" I stopped, swallowed. "But if there is... you should know. Eleanor's dead. Her network is destroyed. The people she hurt for fifty years—they're finally getting justice."

I pulled the locket from my pocket—I'd been carrying it since Sarah gave it to me, unable to put it down. The two photographs inside, Marcus and Helen, captured forever in their youth.

"I'm going to tell your story. Catherine's story. Marcus's story. All of it." I pressed the locket to my lips, then placed it beside the ring. "I'm going to make sure no one forgets what she did to you. What you sacrificed to protect your son. To protect me."

I stayed there for a long time, kneeling in the cold, watching the winter light fade into gray.

---

That evening, I met my father at the same diner where I'd eaten a hundred meals over the years—greasy burgers, bad coffee, the kind of place where cops and construction workers rubbed elbows and no one asked questions.

We sat in a booth near the back, the one with the crack in the vinyl seat that had been there since before I joined the force. Robert ordered coffee and pie, his usual. I ordered nothing. My appetite had disappeared days ago and hadn't returned.

"Margaret showed me Catherine's book," I said. "She wants me to publish it."

Robert nodded slowly, unsurprised. "Are you going to?"

"I don't know." I stared at the table, at the scratches and stains that told stories of their own. "It's not just about Eleanor. It's about you. About Grandma. About Marcus. Once that book comes out, everyone will know the truth. About who you really are. About who *I* really am."

"The grandson of a shipping clerk who fell in love with the wrong woman." Robert's voice was wry. "Not exactly a scandal."

"You know what I mean."

"I do." Robert set down his coffee cup. "James, I've spent my whole life hiding. First because my mother made me promise. Then because Eleanor was still alive. Then because... hell, I don't know. Habit, maybe. Fear. The belief that some truths are better left buried."

"And now?"

"Now I'm seventy-three years old. Eleanor is dead. Her network is crumbling. And I've got a son who barely speaks to me because I spent forty years keeping him at arm's length." Robert's eyes met mine, and I saw something I'd never seen there before: vulnerability. "Publish the book, James. Tell the truth. Let the whole world know who the Webbs were and what Eleanor did to them."

"It'll change everything."

"Everything's already changed." Robert reached across the table and gripped my hand—the first time in my memory he'd ever initiated contact like that. "I'm tired of secrets, son. I'm tired of lies. I'm tired of living like a man who's ashamed of where he came from."

His hand was rough, calloused, the hand of a man who'd worked with his body his whole life. But it was warm. And it was steady.

"Okay," I said. "I'll do it."

BUT the trials were still coming.

Diana Ashworth. Julian Ashworth. David Sterling. Captain Maria Reyes. Chief Harold Morrison. Mayor Thomas Caldwell. Judge Victoria Harper. And a dozen others—network members, enablers, people who had looked the other way for decades while Eleanor built her empire of fear.

The prosecutors were assembling their cases. The defense attorneys were mounting their strategies. The media was circling, hungry for more revelations, more scandal, more blood.

And I was still the lead detective on the original case—the man who would be called to testify against the woman who had poisoned Eleanor, the boy who had tried to strangle her, the lawyer who had driven the final blade home.

The night after Catherine's funeral, I sat in my kitchen with the case files spread before me. Diana's confession. Julian's statement. Sterling's deal for testimony. Sarah's eyewitness account. Rosa's decades of documented evidence. Margaret's FBI reports. Catherine's forty years of research.

A lifetime of pain and secrets, reduced to paper and ink.

My phone buzzed. A text from Margaret: *Trial dates set. Diana first, January 15. Julian follows. Sterling will testify against both in exchange for reduced charges. Are you ready?*

I typed back: *No. But I will be.*

Ready or not, the final chapter was about to begin. The truth had been uncovered, the network dismantled, the guilty identified. Now came the harder part—the part where justice was supposed to be served.

THEREFORE, as I gathered the files and prepared for the weeks ahead, I allowed myself one small moment of doubt. Not about the evidence, which was overwhelming. Not about the guilt of the accused, which was clear. But about justice itself—whether courts and judges and juries could ever truly account for what Eleanor Ashworth had done.

She had murdered. She had destroyed. She had corrupted an entire system to serve her ends. And in the end, her own family had risen up to destroy her—not as justice, but as a kind of terrible liberation.

Was that enough? Would the trials and verdicts and sentences ever truly balance the scales?

I didn't know. But I knew one thing: I was going to see this through. For my grandmother, who had loved a man Eleanor destroyed. For Catherine, who had spent forty years keeping the flame alive. For Marcus Webb, whose ring now sat on my finger, whose love had outlasted death and time and everything Eleanor had tried to do to bury it.

The trials were coming. The truth would be told. And somewhere, I hoped, the dead were finally at peace.
