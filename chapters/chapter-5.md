# Three Hands, One Death

The drive back to the Ashworth estate felt longer than it should have. My head throbbed where the attacker had struck me, a constant drumbeat of pain that matched the rhythm of my thoughts. Three methods of death. Three different time frames. Three possible killers.

Or one very clever murderer who wanted it to look that way.

I pulled through the wrought-iron gates at seven-fifteen, the morning light painting the Gothic mansion in shades of pale gold that did nothing to soften its severity. Two patrol cars were already parked in the circular drive—Reyes had made good on her promise of backup—and I could see officers stationed at the main entrance, their breath misting in the cold air.

The dawn had come and gone. The masked figure's deadline had passed. Whatever consequences they'd promised, I would face them with my eyes open.

I parked and sat for a moment, studying the house. Seven suspects, if you counted Sterling and Rosa. Six, if you believed Rosa's story about Eleanor destroying my grandmother. But now, with the medical examiner's findings, the calculus had changed. I wasn't looking for one killer anymore. I was potentially looking for three.

*Poison. Strangulation. Stabbing.*

Who had done what? And why?

The front door opened before I could knock, and Diana Ashworth stood framed in the doorway, looking like she hadn't slept. Her makeup was smudged, her hair loose around her shoulders, and there was a fragility to her that hadn't been present during our first encounter.

"Detective." Her voice was flat, exhausted. "We've been waiting for you."

"All of you?"

"Captain Reyes insisted. No one has been allowed to leave. We've been up all night, trapped in this mausoleum with—" She broke off, pressing a hand to her mouth. "I'm sorry. I'm not usually this... undone."

I followed her inside, noting the way her hands trembled slightly as she smoothed her hair. Fear? Guilt? Exhaustion? With this family, it could be any or all of those.

"Where is everyone?"

"The drawing room. Your captain has been asking questions, but she said she needed to wait for you before..." Diana trailed off. "Before what, exactly? What's happening?"

"There's been a development in the investigation."

Her eyes widened. "What kind of development?"

I didn't answer. I couldn't—not yet, not until I'd looked each of them in the face and watched their reactions to what I was about to reveal.

---

The drawing room had the atmosphere of a prison waiting room. Victor sat in the same chair he'd occupied yesterday, but the arrogance had been stripped away, leaving something smaller and more afraid. Margot was curled in the corner of a settee, still in her nightgown, her thin arms wrapped around herself like she was trying to hold her pieces together. Julian stood by the window, staring out at nothing, his young face aged by a night of terror. And David Sterling sat apart from the family, his briefcase on his lap like a shield, his expression carefully blank.

Captain Reyes met me at the door, pulling me aside before I could enter fully.

"Rosa Martinez is in stable condition at Millbrook General," she said quietly. "Concussion, some bruising, but she'll recover. She's refusing to talk about what happened at the chapel, says she'll only speak to you."

"And the evidence she mentioned? The documents?"

Reyes's expression was grim. "We found them hidden beneath the altar. Decades of records—payments, photographs, names and dates going back thirty years. If even half of it is legitimate, Eleanor Ashworth was involved in things that make murder look like jaywalking."

"Does the family know?"

"Not yet. I was waiting for you."

I nodded and stepped fully into the room. Every head turned toward me. Every pair of eyes held something different—fear, suspicion, hope, desperation.

"Good morning." I kept my voice neutral, professional, though my head was pounding and every muscle ached from my ordeal at the chapel. "Thank you for your patience. I know this has been a difficult night."

"Difficult?" Victor's voice was sharp, brittle. "We've been treated like criminals. Held prisoner in our own home. My mother is dead, and instead of finding her killer, you're—"

"Mr. Ashworth." I cut him off, and something in my tone made him fall silent. "I spent last night being attacked, bound, and threatened by someone who knows more about your mother's death than they should. So I'm not really in the mood for complaints about inconvenience."

The room went very still.

"What happened?" Margot's voice was barely a whisper.

"I was meeting with Rosa Martinez at the old chapel on your property. Someone was waiting for us. Someone who wanted to make sure certain secrets stayed buried." I paused, letting that sink in. "Someone in this room, possibly. Someone who was willing to kill to protect themselves."

Diana's face went pale. "You can't think we—"

"I think one of you poisoned Eleanor Ashworth's tea sometime during or after dinner. I think another one of you strangled her—started to, anyway, then stopped. And I think a third person finished the job with a letter opener." I watched their faces as I spoke, looking for tells, cracks, confessions. "The medical examiner has confirmed that the three methods of death were not administered at the same time. They happened in sequence, possibly over the course of hours."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Then Victor laughed—a harsh, desperate sound. "You're saying three different people tried to kill my mother?"

"I'm saying three different methods were used at three different times. Whether that means three killers or one very theatrical murderer, I don't know yet." I pulled out my notebook, though I already knew what I was going to ask. "I need each of you to account for your movements last night. Not just where you were between midnight and three. I need to know everything—every moment from the end of dinner until Rosa found the body."

Julian was the first to speak. His voice was steady, but I could see his hands shaking. "After dinner, I went to my room to study. Around ten, I came down to the kitchen for coffee. Rosa was there, cleaning up. We talked for a few minutes—nothing important, just small talk. Then I went back upstairs."

"Did you see anyone else? Hear anything?"

"I heard voices from the library around eleven. Grandma and Mr. Sterling, I assumed—they were still working on whatever business they had." Julian's eyes flickered toward the attorney. "And around midnight, I heard footsteps in the hallway outside my room. Heavy, quick, like someone was in a hurry."

"Did you look to see who it was?"

He shook his head. "I was half-asleep. I just assumed it was someone going to the bathroom or getting water."

I turned to Diana. "Mrs. Ashworth?"

She took a shaky breath. "After dinner, I went to the conservatory. I needed air—the tension at that table was suffocating. I stayed there until... maybe nine-thirty? Then I went to our room." She glanced at Victor. "My husband was already there."

"You said yesterday that you took a sleeping pill around eleven."

"Yes. I have chronic insomnia. I've had it for years." Her voice dropped. "The pills make me sleep like the dead. I wouldn't have heard anything, even if it happened right outside my door."

Victor's jaw tightened at her words, but he didn't contradict her. When I looked at him, he met my gaze with something that might have been defiance or might have been fear.

"I was in my study until ten. Working. Then I went to our room and read until Diana fell asleep. After that..." He hesitated.

"After that?"

"I went back downstairs. Around eleven-thirty."

Diana's head snapped toward him. "What?"

"I couldn't sleep. I knew Mother was still awake—I could see the light in the library from the garden." Victor's voice was flat, toneless. "I went to talk to her. To try to make things right."

"About what, Mr. Ashworth?"

He was silent for a long moment. Then, quietly: "She knew about the money."

"What money?"

"Over the past two years, I've been... borrowing from the family accounts. Just small amounts at first, to cover some investments that didn't pan out. But it grew. Compounded." He swallowed hard. "Mother found out last week. She confronted me at dinner, in front of everyone, and I denied it. Said she was losing her mind, imagining things."

Diana made a sound of disbelief. "You never told me."

"I was going to pay it back. I had a plan—"

"How much?" I interrupted. "How much did you take?"

Victor's face crumpled. "Two hundred thousand dollars. Give or take."

The room erupted. Diana was on her feet, screaming accusations. Julian looked like he'd been physically struck. Even Margot emerged from her cocoon of silence to stare at her brother with something like horror.

I let them rage for a moment, watching, cataloging. Then I raised my voice above the chaos.

"That's why she was changing her will. She was going to disinherit you."

Victor went very still. "How do you know about the will?"

"Mr. Sterling was kind enough to share the details." I glanced at the attorney, who gave a barely perceptible nod. "Your mother was planning to cut you out entirely. Everything was going to Julian."

Julian's face went white. "I didn't know. I swear I didn't—"

"Save it." I turned back to Victor. "You went to the library at eleven-thirty. What happened?"

"We argued. She accused me of betraying the family, of being a disappointment, of—" His voice broke. "She said she wished I had died instead of my father. She said the only decent thing I'd ever done was produce Julian."

"And then?"

"And then I left. She was alive when I left, Detective. Angry, cruel, but alive." He met my gaze, and for the first time, I saw something genuine in his eyes—not grief, exactly, but a kind of devastated acceptance. "I didn't kill her. I wanted to. God help me, in that moment, I wanted to wrap my hands around her throat and squeeze until she stopped talking."

Diana gasped. Victor ignored her.

"But I didn't. I walked out, went to my study, and drank until I passed out." He laughed bitterly. "Not exactly an alibi that covers me in glory, but it's the truth."

I studied him for a long moment, measuring his claims against the tension in his jaw, the tremor in his hands, against everything I knew about this family. He was telling the truth about the argument—that much I believed. But whether he was telling the truth about what came after...

"Miss Ashworth?" I turned to Margot. "Your turn."

She looked at me with those haunted eyes, and for a moment, I thought she wouldn't answer. Then, slowly, she began to speak.

"I don't sleep much. Haven't in years. After dinner, I went to my room and tried to read, but I couldn't concentrate. Around midnight, I went down to the kitchen to make tea."

"Did you see anyone?"

"Rosa was there again, puttering around. She said she couldn't sleep either." Margot's voice was soft, dreamy. "We talked for a while. About nothing, really. Then I took my tea to the conservatory."

"Why the conservatory?"

"It's the only place in this house where I can breathe. Where Mother's presence doesn't press down on me like a stone." Her thin hands twisted in her lap. "I stayed there until I heard Rosa screaming."

"You didn't go to the library? Didn't see your mother at all after dinner?"

Something flickered in Margot's eyes. "No."

She was lying. I could feel it in my bones, see it in the tiny tremor of her hands. But I didn't push—not yet. Let her think she'd gotten away with it. Let her grow confident in the lie.

I turned to David Sterling. "Mr. Sterling. You were working with Eleanor until nearly midnight. What happened after you left the library?"

The attorney's face was carefully composed. "I went to my room and slept until Rosa's screams woke me. As I told Captain Reyes this morning, I heard nothing unusual during the night."

"The library is directly below the guest rooms, isn't it?"

Sterling blinked. "I suppose it is."

"And yet you heard nothing? No arguments, no sounds of struggle, no—"

"I'm a heavy sleeper, Detective. I also take medication for my blood pressure that tends to enhance that effect." He spread his hands. "I wish I could be more helpful, but I simply didn't hear anything."

Another dead end. Another suspect with a convenient excuse.

I closed my notebook and stood in the center of the room, letting the silence stretch. Each of them was hiding something. Each of them had opportunity. And based on what the medical examiner had found, at least some of them had acted on it.

"Here's what I think happened," I said slowly. "Someone poisoned Eleanor's tea during or shortly after dinner. The toxin was slow-acting—it took at least an hour to fully affect her. By the time Victor went to confront her at eleven-thirty, she was already compromised. Confused, maybe. Disoriented."

Victor's face went gray.

"After Victor left, someone else went to the library. Someone who found Eleanor weakened, vulnerable. Someone who started to strangle her—maybe to finish what the poison had started, maybe out of rage, maybe for some other reason." I paused. "But they stopped. Something interrupted them, or they couldn't go through with it. Either way, they left her alive."

"And then?" Julian's voice was barely audible.

"And then Eleanor—dying, confused, in pain—picked up the letter opener from her desk and ended it herself. The angle of the stab wound is consistent with self-infliction. She chose her own ending, rather than let someone else choose it for her."

The room was silent as a tomb.

"Three methods," I continued. "Poison, strangulation, stabbing. But possibly only two killers—the poisoner and the strangler. Unless one of you wants to tell me something different."

No one spoke. No one moved. They sat frozen, each of them trapped in their own private hell of guilt and fear and terrible knowledge.

"I'll be reviewing the forensic evidence over the next few hours," I said. "The tea cup, the ligature marks, any trace evidence we find. I'll also be looking into Eleanor's financial records, her phone records, and whatever else turns up in that collection of documents Rosa Martinez had been keeping."

At the mention of Rosa's name, something shifted in the room. A flicker of panic, quickly suppressed.

"Someone in this house knows more than they're telling me. Someone attacked Rosa and me last night to keep those secrets buried." I moved toward the door, then paused. "I will find out who. And when I do, I will find out why. The truth always comes out, in the end. Eleanor Ashworth learned that the hard way."

I left them there, suspended in their silence, and made my way to the library. The crime scene tape was still up, the room still frozen in the moment of death, but I wasn't here to examine the body. I was here to think.

Three methods. Three time frames. Three possible killers.

But the masked figure at the chapel had implied something more—had asked me to consider what it meant that someone would need to kill Eleanor three different ways. The answer seemed obvious now: multiple people wanted her dead. Multiple people had tried to make it happen. And in the end, Eleanor herself had finished what they'd started.

But why? Why would Eleanor choose to kill herself? Pride? Pain? Or something else—some final act of control, some last manipulation from beyond the grave?

I thought about the locket. About my grandmother. About thirty years of lies and cruelty and destroyed lives.

*Sometimes justice doesn't look like handcuffs and courtrooms.*

The masked figure's words echoed in my head. They'd known about Eleanor's crimes—about the accidents that weren't accidents, the disappearances, the ruined lives. They'd called it justice.

And part of me—the part that still saw my grandmother's face every time I closed my eyes—wanted to agree.

But I was a cop. I'd sworn an oath. And whatever Eleanor Ashworth had done, whatever she'd deserved, someone had taken the law into their own hands. Multiple someones, apparently. And I couldn't let that stand, no matter how much I understood it.

My phone buzzed. A message from Reyes.

*Phone records came in. You need to see this.*

I pocketed the phone and headed for the door. The truth was out there, buried under decades of Ashworth secrets. And I was running out of time to find it.

Behind me, the library sat silent, still holding its dead. But somewhere in this house, a killer—or killers—was planning their next move.

And I had a feeling it was going to involve me.
