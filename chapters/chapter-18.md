# The Confession

The phone rang four times before Sarah answered. When she did, her voice was careful, guarded—the voice of someone who'd been expecting this call.

"James."

"We need to talk."

"I know." A pause, heavy with unspoken things. "I've been watching the news. About Morrison and Caldwell being taken in. About Captain Reyes." Another pause. "I assume you're putting pieces together."

"Are you at the motel?"

"No. I left after our last conversation. I'm at—" She hesitated. "I'm at the old Ashworth chapel. The one where Rosa was attacked."

The chapel. Where this whole investigation had first turned personal. Where the masked figure had given me an ultimatum that felt like a lifetime ago.

"Why there?"

"Because it's where the truth lives, James. It's where all of this started, in a way." Her voice cracked slightly. "I need to show you something. I need to tell you something. But I need to do it here, where the ghosts can hear it too."

---

I shouldn't have gone alone. I knew that even as I disconnected the IV line and swung my legs over the hospital bed. Margaret was still coordinating with her team; my father had fallen asleep in the chair, exhausted from the day's revelations; Catherine was on the phone with her contact at the *Detroit Free Press*. No one noticed me slip out.

The night was cold, the kind of cold that sinks into your bones and makes you feel every year you've lived. I took a taxi to the edge of the Ashworth property, then walked the rest of the way on the overgrown path that wound through the back of the estate.

The chapel rose out of the darkness like a specter. Abandoned for decades, its stones were crumbling, its stained-glass windows long shattered. Vines crept up the walls like grasping fingers. A faint light flickered inside—candlelight, I realized. Sarah had made herself at home among the ruins.

I pushed open the heavy wooden door. The hinges screamed in protest, announcing my arrival to anyone who might be listening.

Sarah sat in the front pew, facing the empty altar where a cross had once hung. She was wearing a dark coat, her hair loose around her shoulders, and in the candlelight I could see the exhaustion etched into her face. The years since our divorce had been kind to her—or so I'd thought. Now, in this dim and haunted place, she looked every day of the time that had passed.

Around her neck, catching the light of the candles, hung a gold heart-shaped locket.

My grandmother's locket.

"How long?" My voice echoed off the stone walls. "How long have you had it?"

Sarah's hand moved to touch the locket, a gesture so automatic she probably wasn't even aware of it. "Since before we met. Your grandmother gave it to me."

"That's not possible. The locket disappeared twenty years ago—"

"Thirty years ago." Sarah turned to face me, and I saw tears streaming down her cheeks. "James, there's so much you don't know. So much I should have told you before we ever got married, before we ever—" She pressed her hand over her mouth, composing herself. "Sit down. Please. This is going to take a while."

I should have demanded answers. Should have arrested her on the spot for obstruction, for withholding evidence, for God knows what else. But something in her eyes—some desperate, devastating truth—made me walk down the aisle and sit beside her in that ancient pew.

"Start at the beginning," I said.

"The beginning." Sarah laughed, but there was no humor in it. "The beginning was thirty-five years ago, when a girl named Rebecca Harper—that was my maiden name—started working as an intern at Ashworth Shipping."

---

"I was nineteen. Fresh out of high school, saving up for college." Sarah's voice took on a distant quality, as if she were narrating a story about someone else. "The Ashworths had a summer internship program. Good pay, prestigious name on your resume. Everyone in Millbrook wanted one of those positions."

"I didn't know you were from Millbrook originally."

"I wasn't, technically. I grew up in Traverse City. But my aunt lived here, and she pulled strings to get me the job." Sarah's fingers traced the edge of the locket. "That's where I met your grandmother. Helen."

I felt the blood drain from my face. "You knew my grandmother?"

"She was Eleanor's secretary then. But she was more than that—she was the one who trained the interns, showed us the ropes, looked after us when Eleanor's moods turned dark." Sarah's eyes met mine. "She was the kindest person I ever met, James. And she saw something in me. Something worth protecting."

"Protecting from what?"

"From Eleanor." Sarah's jaw tightened. "I was young, naive. I thought the internship was about learning business operations. I didn't understand that Ashworth Shipping was a front for money laundering, that half the accounting department was cooking books, that the nice young men in suits who came to the office after hours were not clients but criminals."

"And my grandmother?"

"She tried to shield me from the worst of it. Kept me busy with legitimate work, warned me away from certain meetings, certain conversations." Sarah's voice softened. "But Eleanor noticed me. Noticed that I was curious, that I asked questions, that I was starting to understand more than I should."

The candles flickered, casting dancing shadows across the chapel walls. Outside, an owl called into the darkness.

"What happened?"

"Eleanor decided I was a liability. She told your grandmother to 'handle' me—which, in Eleanor's language, meant make me disappear. But your grandmother refused." Sarah pulled the locket from her neck, held it in her palm so I could see the delicate filigree, the tiny heart-shaped clasp. "She gave me this instead. Told me it was protection. That as long as I wore it, I'd be carrying a piece of the truth with me—a reminder that the monsters could be beaten."

"I don't understand. The locket was my grandmother's most precious possession. Why would she give it to a stranger?"

"Because she was dying, James." Sarah's voice broke on the words. "She'd just been diagnosed. Six months to live, maybe less. And she knew that Eleanor would never let her expose the truth while she was alive—but she hoped that someday, someone else might."

---

The story spilled out of Sarah like water from a broken dam. How my grandmother had helped her escape Millbrook that summer, arranging a scholarship at a college in Indiana under an assumed name. How she'd made Sarah promise to keep the locket safe, to keep it hidden, to wait until the time was right.

"Wait for what?" I asked.

"For Eleanor to die." Sarah's voice was flat. "Your grandmother believed that as long as Eleanor was alive, anyone who tried to expose her would be destroyed. But she also believed that someday, the truth would come out. That someone would be brave enough, or desperate enough, to finish what she started."

"And you just... waited? For thirty-five years?"

"I tried to forget, at first. Changed my name, built a new life. Got married, got divorced, married again—to you." Sarah's laugh was bitter. "Do you know how strange it was, James? Falling in love with the grandson of the woman who saved my life? I told myself it was coincidence. I told myself the universe has a sick sense of humor."

"But it wasn't coincidence, was it?"

"No." Sarah shook her head. "When I found out who you were—who your grandmother was—I should have run. But I couldn't. It was like the locket drew me to you, like some invisible thread connecting us across decades." She looked at me with eyes full of pain. "I did love you, James. That part was real. But I was also waiting. Watching. Hoping that through you, I might finally get close enough to bring Eleanor down."

"You used me."

"I loved you *and* I used you. Both things can be true." Sarah's voice cracked. "I'm not asking for forgiveness. I know I don't deserve it. I'm asking you to understand."

---

The chapel fell silent except for the sound of our breathing. The candles had burned low, their flames guttering in unseen drafts. I should have felt betrayed. Manipulated. Angry.

Instead, I felt something closer to exhaustion. As if every revelation in this case was just another weight added to a burden I'd been carrying my whole life without knowing it.

"The night Eleanor died," I said finally. "Were you there?"

Sarah closed her eyes. When she opened them again, the tears had stopped. What remained was something harder, colder—the face of a woman who had made a terrible decision and was finally ready to own it.

"Yes."

The word dropped between us like a stone into still water.

"I drove from Detroit that evening. I'd been planning it for weeks—ever since Victor told me that Eleanor was going to disinherit him, that everything was falling apart." Sarah's voice was steady now, mechanical. "I knew the estate layout from my time with Victor. I knew the routines, the blind spots, the ways in and out without being seen."

"What time did you arrive?"

"Just before midnight. I parked on the access road behind the property and walked through the woods to the garden."

"And then?"

"I went to the library. I wanted to confront her. To tell her that I knew what she'd done to your grandmother, to Marcus Webb, to all the people she'd destroyed over the years." Sarah's hands clenched in her lap. "I was going to show her the locket. To let her know that your grandmother's protection had kept me safe all these years, that her cruelty hadn't won."

"But?"

"But when I got to the library window, I saw—" Sarah's voice faltered. "I saw everything. Diana's poisoned tea taking effect. Victor's confrontation. Julian with his hands around Eleanor's throat. David Sterling with the letter opener." She pressed her hand over her mouth. "I watched them destroy her, one after another, and I did nothing. I just stood there in the darkness, watching through the glass, as the woman who'd haunted my nightmares for thirty-five years finally got what she deserved."

---

I stood up from the pew, unable to sit still any longer. My ribs screamed in protest, but I barely felt them.

"You witnessed the murder."

"Murders," Sarah corrected. "Plural. They all tried to kill her, James. Diana with the poison, Julian with the strangling, Sterling with the blade. Even Eleanor herself, at the end—she grabbed Sterling's hand and helped push the knife home. It was like watching a ritual sacrifice."

"And you didn't intervene. Didn't call the police. Didn't—"

"No." Sarah's voice was small. "I told myself it was justice. That Eleanor deserved everything she got. That all those people—her own family—had more right to punish her than any court ever could."

"That's not justice. That's murder."

"Is it?" Sarah rose to face me, and for the first time I saw something fierce in her expression. "James, she killed Marcus Webb. She drove your grandmother to despair. She destroyed dozens of lives, ruined families, had people killed for daring to cross her. And the system—your system, the police, the courts—did nothing. Because she owned them. Because she was untouchable."

"So you appointed yourself judge and jury?"

"No. I appointed myself witness." Sarah's voice dropped. "I watched, and I did nothing. That's my crime. I let them kill her, and I was glad."

---

The locket gleamed in Sarah's hand, a tiny golden heart holding thirty-five years of secrets. I stared at it, thinking about my grandmother—the woman I'd barely known, who'd died when I was a child, who'd apparently lived a life far more complicated than anyone had told me.

"The locket," I said. "How did it end up in Eleanor's hand?"

Sarah flinched as if I'd struck her.

"After—after it was over—I went inside. I don't know what I was thinking. Closure, maybe. Or proof that she was really dead." Her voice trembled. "She was lying there, bleeding, barely breathing. And she saw me. She saw the locket around my neck, and she—she *laughed*."

"Laughed?"

"She recognized it. Even dying, she recognized it." Sarah's face contorted with old pain. "She said, 'So Helen's ghost has finally come for me.' And then she reached out—reached for the locket—and I—"

Sarah stopped. Her breathing was ragged, uneven.

"I took it off. I put it in her hand. I wanted her to die holding the proof of what she'd destroyed." Sarah's voice broke completely. "I wanted her to feel, in her last moments, the weight of everything she'd done. To know that your grandmother—that all her victims—had won in the end."

"So you contaminated a crime scene. Planted evidence. Made it look like—"

"I made it look like what it was. A reckoning." Sarah met my eyes, and in them I saw no apology. Only the terrible conviction of someone who had made their choice and would live with the consequences. "I'm not sorry, James. I'm not sorry Eleanor is dead. I'm not sorry the people who killed her are finally facing justice. The only thing I'm sorry about is that I couldn't be honest with you from the beginning."

---

I should have arrested her. That was the law—the protocol—the right thing to do. Sarah had witnessed a murder and failed to report it. She'd tampered with evidence. She'd obstructed justice in ways that could complicate every prosecution we'd built.

But as I stood in that ruined chapel, looking at the woman who'd been my wife, who'd kept secrets that stretched back decades before our marriage, I found I couldn't move.

Because she was right about one thing: Eleanor Ashworth had been a monster. She had destroyed lives, ended lives, corrupted an entire system to protect herself. And the law—my law—had failed to stop her.

"What do you want from me?" I asked finally.

"The truth." Sarah pressed the locket into my palm, closing my fingers around it. "I want you to tell the truth. About Eleanor. About your grandmother. About all of it. Not just in court, where lawyers will twist and distort everything. But to the world."

"Catherine's already planning to go public. The *Detroit Free Press*, federal prosecutors—"

"Then let me be part of it." Sarah's voice was urgent now. "Let me testify. Let me tell them what I saw that night—not to protect myself, but to make sure everyone understands what Eleanor was. What she drove people to. I'll face whatever charges come. I'll accept whatever punishment the courts decide. But first—first the truth has to come out. All of it."

---

THEREFORE I stood at a crossroads, both literal and figurative. Behind me lay the path back to the hospital, to Margaret's FBI operation, to the careful legal machinery that would grind through evidence and testimony for years. Ahead lay something messier, more dangerous—the truth, unfiltered and raw, given to the world without the sanitizing influence of lawyers and judges.

Sarah had witnessed Eleanor's murder. She had planted the locket that connected me to the crime. She had kept secrets that tangled through three generations of my family.

But she was also offering something I needed: a firsthand account of what happened in that library. A witness who could corroborate Diana's poisoning, Julian's strangulation, Sterling's fatal blow. Evidence that would make the case against each of them unshakeable.

"One condition," I said.

Sarah waited.

"You tell Margaret everything. Tonight. No more secrets, no more half-truths. She decides whether your testimony helps or hurts the case, and you accept whatever she says."

"And if she says I should be arrested?"

"Then you'll be arrested." I slipped the locket into my pocket. "But at least you'll have told the truth. Finally."

Sarah nodded slowly. "I can live with that."

We walked out of the chapel together, into a night that was just beginning to hint at dawn. Somewhere in the distance, birds were starting to wake, their calls echoing across the Ashworth estate like voices from another world.

The case was almost over. But the reckoning—the real reckoning—was only beginning.
