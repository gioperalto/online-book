# Burden of Blood

Victor Ashworth looked exactly like what old money produces after four generations: soft around the middle, sharp around the eyes, and possessed of that particular brand of arrogance that comes from never having to apologize for anything. He sat in the drawing room like a man attending a mildly inconvenient business meeting, not one whose mother lay dead two rooms away.

"Detective Marlowe." He didn't rise when I entered, just gestured vaguely toward a chair across from him with a hand that held a crystal tumbler of what looked like scotch. At this hour. "I remember you. You used to come around when I was a boy. Something to do with my father's shipping company, wasn't it?"

He was testing me, I realized. Trying to establish that he knew things about me, that the power dynamic here wasn't as simple as detective and suspect. It was a tactic I'd seen before—usually from people with something to hide. But Victor didn't know the half of it. He didn't know that twenty years ago, when I was still the department's rising star fresh off solving the Kellerman kidnapping, I'd investigated a string of embezzlement cases that led right to the edge of Ashworth holdings before the chief at the time told me to back off. "Insufficient evidence," he'd said, though we both knew the real reason. Back then, the brass kept handing me cases they expected me to fail—political hot potatoes, cold cases gone frigid, investigations that had broken better detectives. The Ashworth connection was supposed to be another one of those. But I'd gotten too close, and they'd yanked me off before I could finish the job.

I didn't sit. I never did, in the first interview—it put suspects at ease, and I didn't want Victor Ashworth at ease. Instead, I positioned myself near the fireplace, where I could watch his face in the morning light streaming through the bay windows. The rain had started again, drops sliding down the glass like tears the family hadn't bothered to shed.

"I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Ashworth."

"Are you?" He tilted his head, studying me with those calculating eyes. "My mother was seventy-three years old and had been in declining health for two years. Her death, while unfortunate, was hardly unexpected."

"The manner of it was."

Something flickered across his face. Too quick to identify, gone before I could catalog it. "Yes. Well. I'm sure you'll find whoever did this. That's your job, isn't it?"

I pulled out my notebook, taking my time. Let him stew. Let him wonder what I already knew.

"Where were you last night, Mr. Ashworth? Between midnight and three a.m.?"

"Asleep. In my room. Like any reasonable person would be at that hour."

"Can anyone verify that?"

"My wife, Diana. We share a bed, Detective, though I'm not sure that's any of your business."

"In a murder investigation, Mr. Ashworth, everything is my business." I kept my voice flat, professional. "When did you last see your mother alive?"

Victor shifted in his chair, the first crack in his composure. "Dinner. We all had dinner together in the formal dining room. Mother insisted on these family gatherings whenever Julian came home from school. Said it was important to maintain traditions." He took a sip of his scotch, ice cubes clinking against crystal.

"What time did dinner end?"

Victor considered this, his eyes drifting toward the ceiling as if the answer might be written there. "Around nine, I suppose. Maybe nine-thirty. Rosa had prepared a four-course meal—Mother wouldn't have it any other way. David. That's David Sterling, Mother's attorney. He and Mother retired to the library afterward to discuss some business matters. The rest of us went our separate ways."

"What kind of business matters?"

Now Victor's mask slipped fully. His jaw tightened, and I watched his hands curl into fists on the armrests. "I don't know. I wasn't invited to participate."

"That bothered you."

"What bothers me, Detective, is being interrogated like a common criminal while my mother's body grows cold. What bothers me is that someone violated the sanctity of this home. My home. And committed this atrocity. What I would like is for you to stop wasting time questioning the family and start looking for the real killer."

I let the silence stretch between us, heavy and uncomfortable. Victor Ashworth was hiding something. That much was obvious. The question was whether it was garden-variety family dysfunction or something more sinister.

"Tell me about your relationship with your mother."

"She was my mother." He said it like that explained everything. Maybe, in families like this, it did.

"Were you close?"

Victor laughed, a short, bitter sound. "Close? Eleanor Ashworth wasn't close to anyone, Detective. She collected people the way other women collect porcelain figurines. Useful objects to be displayed and discarded as she saw fit."

"That's a harsh assessment."

"It's an honest one." He met my gaze, and for a moment, I saw something real behind the practiced indifference. Pain, maybe. Or relief. "My mother controlled everyone in this family. Every decision, every relationship, every opportunity. She held the purse strings like a noose around our necks."

"And now she's dead."

"And now she's dead." Victor's lips curved into something that wasn't quite a smile. "I suppose that makes me a suspect, doesn't it? The resentful son, finally free of his domineering mother."

"Does it?"

He stood abruptly, crossing to the window to stare out at the rain-soaked grounds. His reflection in the glass looked older than the man himself, more worn.

"I didn't kill my mother, Detective Marlowe. I had no reason to. In a few years. Maybe less, given her health. I would have inherited everything anyway. Why would I risk everything by rushing the inevitable?"

It was a good point. Logical. Exactly the kind of thing an intelligent murderer would say.

"What about your sister? Margot?"

Victor's shoulders stiffened. "What about her?"

"I understand she and your mother weren't on the best of terms."

He turned from the window, and now there was something new in his expression. Protective, almost fierce. "My sister has had a difficult life, Detective. Much of it thanks to our mother's interference. But Margot isn't capable of violence. She's too—" He searched for the word. "Fragile."

"Fragile people have killed before."

"Not Margot."

I made a note, more to give myself time to think than because I needed to record anything. The family dynamics were revealing themselves like layers of an onion. Bitter and liable to make you cry.

"One more question, Mr. Ashworth. The locket your mother was holding when she died. Do you recognize it?"

The change was instantaneous. Victor's face went pale, then flushed, cycling through emotions too quickly for me to read.

"What locket?"

"Small, gold, heart-shaped. She was clutching it in her right hand."

"I don't." He stopped, swallowed hard. "I don't know anything about any locket."

He was lying. I knew it as surely as I knew my own name. But before I could press further, the drawing room doors burst open and a whirlwind of silk and fury swept into the room.

"Victor! They won't let me leave! Those police officers out front say I can't take my car." The woman stopped short when she saw me, her perfectly made-up face rearranging itself into an expression of haughty displeasure. "Who are you?"

"Detective James Marlowe," I said. "And you must be Diana Ashworth."

Diana was everything Victor wasn't. Sharp where he was soft, beautiful in a way that seemed calculated rather than natural. Her blonde hair was immaculately styled despite the early hour, her makeup flawless, her designer clothes chosen to suggest wealth without appearing to try. She looked like someone who had practiced being an Ashworth in the mirror until she got it right.

"Detective." She made the word sound like an insult. "I hope you're here to tell us this nightmare is over."

"I'm afraid it's just beginning, Mrs. Ashworth."

Her eyes narrowed. "I want to call my lawyer."

"You're not under arrest. You don't need a lawyer for a simple interview."

"There's nothing simple about this situation." She moved to stand beside Victor, presenting a unified front. "My mother-in-law is dead, murdered in her own home, and instead of finding the person responsible, you're harassing her family."

"I'm investigating, Mrs. Ashworth. There's a difference."

"Is there?" She crossed her arms. "Ask your questions, then. I have nothing to hide."

I studied her for a moment. The defensive posture, the too-bright eyes, the slight tremor in her hands that her bravado couldn't quite conceal.

"Where were you last night between midnight and three a.m.?"

"In bed. With my husband. As he's already told you, I'm sure."

"Did you hear anything unusual? See anything?"

"I took a sleeping pill around eleven. I didn't hear anything until Rosa started screaming at three in the morning." Her voice cracked slightly on the last words, and for a moment, she seemed almost human. "It was a terrible sound. I'll never forget it."

"What was your relationship with Eleanor?"

Diana exchanged a glance with Victor. Quick, loaded with meaning I couldn't decipher.

"She was my mother-in-law," Diana said carefully. "We had a cordial relationship."

"That's not what I've heard."

Her composure cracked. "What exactly have you heard, Detective?"

"That Eleanor didn't approve of your marriage. That she tried to convince Victor to divorce you. That she threatened to cut him off entirely if he didn't."

Victor stepped forward. "That's enough. My wife doesn't have to."

"It's fine, Victor." Diana put a hand on his arm, stilling him. When she looked at me again, her eyes were cold. "Eleanor didn't approve of anyone who wasn't born into her precious social circle. She thought I was a gold-digger, a social climber, someone beneath the Ashworth name. She made my life miserable for the first five years of our marriage."

"And after that?"

"After that, I stopped caring what she thought." Diana lifted her chin. "I loved my husband. I built a life with him. Eleanor's approval was never something I needed."

"But her money was."

The silence that followed was deafening. Victor looked at me with naked hatred. Diana's mask slipped entirely, revealing something hard and desperate underneath.

"We're done here," Victor said. "If you have any more questions, you can direct them to our attorney."

I nodded, tucking my notebook away. "I'll be in touch, Mr. Ashworth. Mrs. Ashworth. Don't leave town."

I was almost to the door when Diana's voice stopped me.

"Detective Marlowe?"

I turned.

She was standing very still, one hand pressed against her stomach in a gesture that seemed unconscious. "When you catch whoever did this, I want to know why. Not for Eleanor's sake. For my own. I need to understand how someone could do something so thorough."

It was an odd word choice. Thorough. Three methods of death. Poison, strangulation, stabbing. As if someone wanted to make absolutely certain Eleanor Ashworth stayed dead.

"When I find out, Mrs. Ashworth, you'll be the first to know."

I left them standing together in the drawing room, husband and wife, united in their grief or their guilt. I couldn't yet tell which.

Margot Ashworth was nothing like her brother. Where Victor was polished and controlled, Margot was raw, unfinished, as if life had sanded away all her protective layers and left only exposed nerve.

I found her in the conservatory, a glass-walled room at the back of the house that required walking through a long corridor lined with more portraits and then down a short flight of steps. The space was filled with exotic plants and the humid smell of growing things—a stark contrast to the cold formality of the rest of the mansion. She was sitting on a wrought-iron bench, still in her nightgown, her dark hair tangled and her feet bare despite the chill that seeped through the glass.

"Miss Ashworth?"

She looked up at me with eyes that seemed too large for her thin face. "You're the detective. Rosa told me you'd want to talk to me."

"If you're up for it."

"Does it matter?" She laughed, a hollow sound that echoed off the glass walls. "Nothing I say matters. It never has."

I sat down on the bench across from her, trying to seem less threatening. Up close, I could see the shadows under her eyes, the way her hands twisted in her lap like trapped birds.

"Tell me about your mother, Margot."

"My mother." She said the words like they were in a foreign language. "My mother was a monster, Detective. A beautiful, brilliant, terrible monster who destroyed everyone who got too close to her."

"That's strong language."

"It's the truth." Her eyes met mine, and I was startled by the clarity in them. Whatever Victor thought about his sister being fragile, there was steel underneath the broken surface. "My mother drove my father to an early grave with her demands and her cruelty. She controlled Victor's entire life. Who he married, where he worked, how he raised his son. And me—" She trailed off, looking away.

"What did she do to you?"

"She made me into this." Margot gestured at herself. The nightgown, the bare feet, the wild hair. "When I was eighteen, I fell in love. A boy from town, not rich, not important, but kind. So kind." Her voice caught. "Mother found out. She paid him to leave. Gave him enough money to disappear, and he took it without a backward glance."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. It was twenty years ago. I should be over it by now." But her eyes glistened with tears that said otherwise. "After that, there were problems. Hospitals. Medications. Mother told everyone I was 'delicate.' But the truth is, she broke me, Detective. She broke me, and she never once apologized."

I thought about the photograph on my kitchen table, about my own complicated history with this family. "Did you kill her, Margot?"

She didn't flinch from the question. "No. I wanted to, sometimes. In my darkest moments, I imagined it. But no. I didn't kill her."

"Where were you last night?"

"In my room. Alone. I don't sleep well, so I was awake most of the night, reading." She smiled sadly. "I have no alibi, Detective. But I also have no blood on my hands. Make of that what you will."

I stood, my knees aching from the damp cold of the conservatory. "Thank you for your honesty, Miss Ashworth."

"Detective?" She caught my sleeve as I turned to go. "The locket they found with Mother. I saw them photographing it."

My heart stuttered. "What do you know about it?"

"It belonged to someone Mother destroyed a long time ago. Someone who trusted her and paid the price." Margot's eyes were ancient, knowing. "If you want to solve this murder, Detective Marlowe, you need to look into the past. All of Mother's sins are catching up with her now. Even in death."

I stared at her for a long moment. "Whose locket was it, Margot?"

But she just shook her head and turned back to the rain-streaked glass, a pale ghost among the green.

---

I stepped outside for air, finding my way through a maze of hallways to a covered porch at the back of the house. The rain hammered the grounds into mud, and I stood there watching it fall, letting the cold air bite at my face. My hands were shaking. From cold, I told myself, though I knew better.

The locket. Someone else knew about the locket.

I lit a cigarette—a habit I'd quit and restarted half a dozen times over the years—and smoked it down to the filter before pulling out my phone. The number I dialed was one I knew by heart but hadn't called in three years. Each ring felt like a small eternity. It rang four times before a familiar voice answered.

"Hello?"

"Sarah." Her name felt strange in my mouth, like a word in a dead language. "It's James. I need to talk to you about the Ashworth case."

A long pause. Then: "I wondered when you'd call."

"You've heard."

"It's all over the news. Eleanor Ashworth, dead." Another pause, heavy with things unsaid. "Are you okay?"

I thought about the question. About the weight of the past pressing down on me. About the locket in Eleanor's dead hand. My grandmother's locket, the one that had disappeared twenty years ago along with every chance I'd had at a normal life.

"No," I said finally, the admission costing me more than I wanted to acknowledge. "I don't think I am."

A long pause. I could hear her breathing on the other end, could almost picture her standing in whatever kitchen or living room she occupied now, processing the weight behind my words.

"James."

"I'll come see you tonight. After I finish here. It might be late—nine, maybe ten, depending on how the interviews go. There are things I need to tell you. Things I should have told you three years ago."

I hung up before she could respond, before I could lose my nerve. The rain continued to fall, washing the world clean while the Ashworth house loomed behind me, full of secrets and lies and at least one murderer who thought they could get away with their crime.

They were wrong.

Whatever it cost me, whatever ghosts I had to face, I was going to find the truth.

Even if it destroyed me in the process.
