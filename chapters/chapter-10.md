# Sparks and Tinder

The holding cells at Millbrook station were a study in institutional gray, located in the basement of a building that had seen better decades. I'd walked past the booking desk, down two flights of stairs, and through a security checkpoint before reaching this corridor. Concrete walls, fluorescent lights that buzzed like dying insects, benches bolted to the floor. I stood on the free side of the bars, watching Diana Ashworth sit with her hands folded in her lap, composed as ever despite the circumstances.

She looked up when I approached, her posture straightening almost imperceptibly. "Detective Marlowe. I didn't expect to see you again so soon."

"I have more questions."

"I thought my confession was thorough." A ghost of her old smile crossed her face. "Did I leave something out?"

I pulled a metal chair from the corridor—its legs scraping against the concrete floor with a sound that echoed off the walls—and sat facing her through the bars. The clock on the wall read 11:47 AM. Three hours since I'd arrested her at the estate, the drive to the station having taken nearly half an hour with Diana sitting silent in the back of the patrol car. Three hours since I'd thought the case was closed.

But cases are never closed until they're closed. That was something old Sergeant Miller used to say back when I was breaking into homicide, back when the brass assigned me every cold case and political landmine they could find. "Marlowe," he'd tell me, "the brass thinks they're setting you up to fail. They don't know you yet." He was right. By the time they figured out I wasn't going to fail, I'd solved the Patterson disappearance—a case that had sat cold for eight years—and the department had to either promote me or explain why they weren't. They promoted me. And kept handing me impossible cases, only now because they expected me to solve them. My reputation in this small town had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

"You said you poisoned Eleanor to incapacitate her. That you and Victor planned to search her office while she was disoriented."

"Yes."

"What were you looking for?"

Diana's composure flickered—just for an instant, a shadow crossing her carefully maintained mask. "Evidence. Documents. Anything Eleanor had that she could use against us."

"Against you specifically? Or against Victor?"

"Against both of us." She shifted on the bench, the first sign of discomfort I'd seen since her arrest. "Eleanor collected secrets the way some people collect antiques. She had files on everyone—family, staff, business associates. Anyone who might become useful or dangerous."

"And you believed she had something on you."

"I knew she did." Diana met my eyes. "Eleanor found out about Victor's embezzlement last week. But that wasn't all she discovered. She also found out that I knew about it—and had known for almost a year."

I processed this. "You knew your husband was stealing from the family."

"I suspected it for longer than that. Victor was never good at hiding things from me. But I didn't confront him because I understood why he was doing it." Her voice hardened. "Eleanor's money comes with chains, Detective. Every dollar Victor received from the family fortune was another link in the collar she kept around his neck. The embezzlement was his way of building a small reserve—money she couldn't control, couldn't take away."

"He was paying off Sarah Marlowe with it."

"I know." Diana's smile was bitter. "I've known about Sarah since before my wedding. Eleanor made sure of that—she told me on my wedding day, wanted me to understand exactly what kind of man I was marrying. A man who had loved someone else, who had been too weak to fight for her, who would always carry that failure with him."

"And you married him anyway."

"I married him because Eleanor underestimated me." Diana leaned forward, and I saw a fire in her eyes that hadn't been there before. "She thought I was just another gold-digger, another opportunist looking for Ashworth money. She never imagined I might have my own reasons for wanting into this family."

"What reasons?"

Diana didn't answer. Instead, she reached into the pocket of her blazer—the officers had let her keep it, a small dignity—and pulled out a worn photograph. She slid it through the bars toward me.

A woman in a modest dress, standing in front of a small apartment building. She was smiling, but there was something tired in her eyes. Something familiar.

"She looks like you," I said.

"That was taken a month before she lost her job." Diana's voice was flat. "Before Eleanor destroyed her."

I flipped the photo over. On the back, a handwritten note: *Marie Chen, Ashworth Shipping, Employee of the Month, April 1994.*

"Your mother worked for the Ashworths."

"Look at the next item."

Diana pulled out a creased document and passed it through the bars. A termination notice, official letterhead, dated May 1994. *Termination for cause: Theft of company funds ($10,000 from petty cash).* At the bottom, a single signature: Eleanor Ashworth.

"She didn't steal anything."

"Keep reading."

I found another paper, folded inside the termination notice. A memo on Ashworth Shipping letterhead, marked *CONFIDENTIAL*:

*RE: Accounting discrepancies identified by M. Chen*
*Shell company payments flagged: Atlantic Holdings, Coastal Investments, Harbor Trust*
*Recommend immediate termination before further investigation*
*—D. Sterling*

David Sterling's signature. Thirty years ago, recommending my mother's firing.

"My mother found the shell companies Eleanor was using to hide money," Diana said quietly. "She asked questions. Within a week, she was accused of theft. The evidence was manufactured—I know because I found this memo years later, hidden in Eleanor's archives."

I looked at the documents spread before me. The happy photograph. The termination letter. The memo that proved the frame-up. Diana hadn't just told me her story—she'd shown me the evidence, piece by piece.

"What happened to her after?"

Diana passed through one final item. A death certificate. *Marie Chen, age 47. Cause of death: Cardiac arrest.*

"She worked three jobs after they fired her. Couldn't get a reference anywhere in Millbrook—Eleanor made sure of that. She died five years later, worn down to nothing." Diana's voice cracked. "The doctors called it a heart attack. But I have the hospital bills too, if you want to see them. I have everything."

I sat back, recalibrating everything I thought I knew about Diana Ashworth. Not a gold-digger. Not an opportunist. A woman who had spent twenty years building a case file against the family she married into. A woman who had gathered evidence while waiting for her chance to strike.

"The search you planned," I said slowly. "It wasn't just about protecting Victor. You were looking for evidence of Eleanor's crimes."

"I was looking for everything." Diana's eyes burned. "The shell companies, the fabricated charges, the destroyed careers—all of it. Eleanor kept records because she was paranoid, because she needed leverage, because she never trusted anyone enough to let them forget what she could do. I knew those records existed. I knew they would prove what she'd done to my mother and dozens of others."

"Did you find them?"

"I never got the chance." Diana's voice went flat. "The poison took longer to work than I expected. By the time I was ready to start searching, Julian had already gone to the library. And then everything fell apart."

I thought about the timeline. Diana waiting in the shadows. Julian attacking his grandmother. Margot witnessing from the doorway. Victor drunk in his study. And underneath it all, Eleanor dying slowly from the poison Diana had slipped into her tea.

"Diana, I need to ask you something important." I leaned closer to the bars. "On the night Eleanor died, what triggered everything? Why that night specifically? You said Eleanor discovered the embezzlement last week—why did you choose to act when you did?"

Diana was silent for so long I thought she wouldn't answer. Then:

"Because of what Eleanor found that afternoon."

"What do you mean?"

"Eleanor spent all day in her office going through old files. Boxes she'd had brought up from the archives in the basement. She was looking for something specific—I could tell by the way she moved, the intensity in her eyes." Diana shook her head. "Around four o'clock, I heard her on the phone. She was speaking in a tone I'd never heard before. Not angry. Not cold. Terrified."

"Who was she talking to?"

"I don't know. But I heard what she said." Diana's voice dropped to a whisper. "She said: 'He's still alive. After all these years, he's still alive. And now he wants what I took from him.'"

The words hung in the air between us. He's still alive.

"Did Eleanor say a name?"

"No. But afterward, she was different. Shaken. She moved through the house like a woman being hunted, checking locks, looking over her shoulder." Diana's eyes met mine. "I've never seen Eleanor afraid of anything, Detective. But that afternoon, she was terrified."

"And that's when you decided to act."

"I saw an opening. Eleanor was distracted, off-balance, vulnerable in a way she'd never been before. I thought—" Diana broke off, laughing bitterly. "I thought this might be my only chance. Twenty years of waiting, and suddenly there she was, afraid and exposed. I couldn't let the moment pass."

I stood up, my mind racing. Someone had called Eleanor that afternoon. Someone who had frightened her badly enough to throw her entire household into chaos. Someone she had believed was dead.

"Diana, did Eleanor keep records of her phone calls? A log, maybe, or an assistant who tracked her communications?"

"David Sterling would know. He handled all of Eleanor's business affairs."

David Sterling. The attorney who had stayed overnight to discuss "business." The man who had been with Eleanor until midnight, who claimed to have heard nothing, who had been notably absent from most of my investigation.

"One more question." I studied Diana's face through the bars. "Do you believe Eleanor deserved to die?"

Diana considered this for a long moment. "I believe Eleanor deserved justice. I believe she should have faced consequences for the lives she destroyed, the families she shattered, the crimes she committed without remorse or accountability." She met my eyes. "But I also believe that death was too easy for her. I wanted her to suffer the way my mother suffered—to lose everything, to watch it crumble around her, to know in her final moments that all her power meant nothing."

"Instead, she chose her own ending."

"Yes." Diana's voice was quiet. "In the end, Eleanor controlled even that. She didn't give any of us the satisfaction of taking it from her."

I turned to leave, then paused at the door.

"Diana? Thank you for your honesty."

"Detective?" Her voice stopped me. "Find out who called her that afternoon. Whoever it was—they're the reason everything happened. The poison, Julian's attack, all of it. We were all just reacting to something set in motion by that phone call."

I nodded and walked away, leaving Diana Ashworth in her cell with her twenty years of vengeance finally spent.

---

I found David Sterling in the Ashworth mansion's study, surrounded by boxes of legal documents. The room smelled of old paper and expensive cologne. Sterling looked up when I entered, his expression guarded behind wire-rimmed glasses.

"Detective Marlowe. I heard about Diana's arrest." He set down the document he'd been reviewing. "Terrible business. I never would have suspected her."

"Mr. Sterling, I need to ask you about the afternoon before Eleanor died."

"Of course. Anything I can do to help."

I studied him as I spoke. Sterling was in his sixties, silver-haired and precisely groomed, with the practiced demeanor of a man who made his living navigating difficult conversations. He'd been Eleanor's attorney for thirty-seven years. He knew her secrets better than anyone alive.

"According to Diana, Eleanor received a phone call around four o'clock that afternoon. A call that frightened her badly. Do you know anything about that?"

Sterling's expression didn't change, but I noticed his hand pause over the documents on the desk. A tell.

"Eleanor received many phone calls," he said carefully. "She was a busy woman."

"This one was different. Diana said Eleanor was 'terrified.' That she mentioned someone being alive—someone she thought was dead." I stepped closer. "I need to know who called her, Mr. Sterling."

A long silence. Sterling removed his glasses and polished them with a silk handkerchief—a delay tactic, buying time to compose his answer.

"I wasn't present for the call," he said finally. "But I can tell you that Eleanor was unsettled when I arrived that evening. She mentioned that certain matters from the past had resurfaced. Old business that she thought was concluded."

"What kind of business?"

"The kind that Eleanor preferred to keep confidential." Sterling's voice was smooth, evasive. "I'm sure you understand, Detective—attorney-client privilege extends beyond death. There are limits to what I can share."

"Eleanor is dead. Diana is in custody for poisoning her. Julian has confessed to attempted strangulation. I need to understand what triggered this entire chain of events, and you're the only one who might know."

Sterling was quiet for a long moment. Then he sighed, a sound of surrender, and leaned back in his chair.

"There are things about Eleanor that even her family doesn't know," he said slowly. "Things I've been protecting for decades. But perhaps—" He shook his head. "Perhaps it's time for the truth to come out."

I waited. The afternoon light filtered through the study's heavy curtains, casting long shadows across the Oriental rug.

"Forty years ago, Eleanor made a decision that shaped the course of this family's history." Sterling's voice had dropped, as if he feared being overheard. "There was a man—a business partner in the shipping company. He had evidence of certain irregularities in Eleanor's handling of the company finances. Evidence that would have destroyed her reputation and possibly led to criminal charges."

"What was his name?"

"Marcus Webb."

I went cold. Marcus Webb—the man who had loved my grandmother. The man Eleanor had transferred to Seattle, who had died in a shipping yard "accident" three years later. The man whose death had been orchestrated to look like equipment failure.

"You knew about Marcus Webb."

"I know everything about Marcus Webb." Sterling's voice was heavy with decades of complicity. "I was the one who drafted the documents that made his transfer look like a promotion. I was the one who arranged for his accident to be classified as workplace negligence. And I was the one who, forty years later, helped Eleanor believe that every loose end had been tied up."

"But something changed."

"Yesterday afternoon." Sterling nodded slowly. "Eleanor received a call from someone claiming to be Marcus Webb's son."

The floor seemed to tilt beneath me. Marcus Webb's son. If my family history was accurate, if the revelations from Catherine Webb were true, then Marcus Webb's son was—

"He identified himself as Robert Marlowe," Sterling continued, watching my face. "Eleanor's research confirmed it. Robert Marlowe—your father, Detective—is the biological son of Marcus Webb."

I couldn't breathe. My father. The man who had raised me, who had disappeared into alcohol and silence after my grandmother died, who had never spoken about his past or his family's connection to the Ashworths.

"My father called Eleanor."

"He did more than call." Sterling's voice was grim. "He demanded a meeting. Said he had evidence—documents that Catherine Webb had been gathering for years, proof of everything Eleanor had done. He told her that if she didn't meet with him, he would take it all to the press."

"That's what frightened her."

"Eleanor was terrified because she had believed Marcus Webb died without anyone knowing the truth. She had no idea he had fathered a child, no idea that child was still alive and hunting for evidence against her." Sterling shook his head. "When she realized that Robert Marlowe was Marcus Webb's son—that Marcus's bloodline had been living in Millbrook all along, watching and waiting—she came undone."

I leaned against the doorframe, my mind reeling. My father. The man I barely spoke to, the man who had retreated into his own world after my grandmother's death, the man who had never explained why he seemed to carry such weight on his shoulders.

He had known. All these years, he had known about Marcus Webb, about Eleanor's crimes, about the legacy of destruction that connected our families.

"Where was my father supposed to meet Eleanor?"

"I don't know." Sterling's voice was careful again, measured. "Eleanor didn't share those details with me. But I know she was planning something. She made several phone calls that evening, gave instructions to people I didn't recognize. She was preparing to handle the situation the way she always handled situations."

"By making it go away."

"Eleanor believed that problems could be solved with sufficient resources and ruthlessness." Sterling's smile was grim. "But your father had forty years of rage behind him. And Catherine Webb had been building a case in the shadows. Eleanor's usual methods weren't going to work this time."

"And so she panicked. She made mistakes. And her entire family chose that night to act against her."

"A perfect storm of consequences." Sterling nodded. "Diana with her poison, Julian with his hands, Victor with his guilt. All of them moving against Eleanor at the same moment, none of them knowing what the others were doing. And underneath it all, your father's phone call—the spark that lit the fuse."

I straightened, my detective's instincts cutting through the shock. "Mr. Sterling, where is my father now?"

"I don't know. But Detective—" Sterling hesitated, then reached into his briefcase and pulled out a slim folder. "Eleanor asked me to prepare this document yesterday evening. It was supposed to be a new will—one that would have cut out everyone except a trust for charitable works. She intended to burn the family to the ground rather than let your father expose her."

I took the folder but didn't open it. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I'm tired." Sterling's voice was raw, exhausted. "Thirty-seven years of protecting Eleanor's secrets, of helping her bury bodies and destroy lives, of pretending that the law could be bent to serve one woman's obsessions." He met my eyes. "Your grandmother was a good woman, Detective. I knew her, briefly, before Eleanor destroyed her. She deserved better than what she got. And so did Marcus Webb."

"You could have stopped it. All those years, you could have spoken up."

"I could have. And every night for four decades, I've wondered what my life would have been if I had." Sterling's laugh was bitter. "But I was a coward. I chose my career, my comfort, my position. And now I get to live with what that choice has cost."

I turned to leave, the folder clutched in my hand.

"Detective?" Sterling's voice stopped me. "Your father may have been the catalyst, but he wasn't the killer. Whatever Eleanor's sins, whatever revenge Robert Marlowe was seeking—he didn't poison her tea or wrap his hands around her throat. That was the family she created, turning on her at last."

"I know who killed Eleanor," I said quietly. "What I need to know now is why my father chose that night to make his move. And where he is now."

---

I stood on the mansion's front steps, the afternoon sun warm on my face, and tried to make sense of everything I'd learned.

My father. Robert Marlowe. The son of Marcus Webb—the man Eleanor had loved, destroyed, and ultimately murdered. My father had known for years, maybe decades, carrying the secret of his true parentage like a stone in his chest. He had watched from a distance as Eleanor continued her reign of terror, waiting for the right moment to strike.

And when that moment came—when Catherine Webb's years of investigation finally bore fruit—he had called Eleanor and set everything in motion.

I pulled out my phone and dialed a number I hadn't called in over a year.

It rang four times. Five. Then:

"James?" My father's voice, gruff and guarded. "Is that you?"

"Dad." The word felt strange in my mouth. "We need to talk."

A long silence. Then: "I suppose we do. I've been expecting this call."

"You know why I'm calling."

"I know Eleanor Ashworth is dead. I know you're the detective on the case." Another pause. "And I know you've figured out who I really am."

I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of generational secrets pressing down on me. "Dad, where are you?"

"I'm at the cemetery. Standing at your grandmother's grave." His voice cracked, just slightly. "I come here every year on the anniversary of her death. This year, I came a few days early."

"Because Eleanor died."

"Because Eleanor finally faced justice." My father's voice hardened. "Not the justice I wanted—not the public exposure, not the trial, not the world knowing what she did. But justice nonetheless. Someone in that house decided they'd had enough, and they did what I'd spent forty years fantasizing about."

"Dad, I need you to tell me everything. About Marcus Webb. About Grandmother. About what you knew and when you knew it."

Another silence, longer this time. When my father spoke again, his voice was different—softer, more vulnerable than I'd ever heard it.

"Come to the cemetery, James. I'll tell you everything. It's time you knew the truth about where you come from."

I ended the call and walked to my car, my mind spinning with questions. In the space of two days, I had learned that my grandmother had been destroyed by Eleanor Ashworth, that my father was the son of Eleanor's murdered lover, and that my ex-wife had been entangled with the Ashworth family for decades.

The case was solved. Diana had poisoned Eleanor. Julian had tried to strangle her. Eleanor had ended her own life.

Yet the story wasn't over. There were still threads to pull, secrets to uncover, a family history that stretched back four decades and touched every person I'd ever loved.

And so I drove to the cemetery, toward my father and the truth I'd been running from my entire life.

The dead were waiting. And they had so much left to tell me.
