# Web of Complicity

Captain Maria Reyes was waiting for me in her office when I returned to the station. The drive from the cemetery had taken longer than expected—road construction on Main Street forced a detour through the warehouse district—and by the time I walked into the building, my coffee had gone cold and my patience thin. The afternoon sun slanted through the blinds of her corner office, striping her desk with bars of gold and shadow. She didn't look up from the paperwork in front of her as I entered, just gestured at the chair across from her.

"Sit."

I sat. The leather creaked beneath me, worn smooth by decades of detectives receiving news they didn't want to hear.

"Diana Ashworth's attorney arrived an hour ago," Reyes said, still not meeting my eyes. "Julian Ashworth has been formally charged with assault. David Sterling is requesting immunity in exchange for testimony." She flipped a page, her silver-streaked hair catching the light. "On paper, this case is wrapped up. Eleanor Ashworth was poisoned by her daughter-in-law, assaulted by her grandson, and ultimately died by her own hand. Three attackers, one victim, one very wealthy family about to tear itself apart in court."

"On paper."

"On paper." Reyes finally looked up. Her dark eyes were sharp, calculating—the same look she'd given me fifteen years ago when she first promoted me to homicide. "But there's something else, isn't there, James? Something you're not putting in your reports."

I thought about the leather pouch in my jacket pocket. Marcus Webb's final letter, pressed against my chest like a second heartbeat. I thought about my father standing at my grandmother's grave, asking me to help expose a network of corruption that had protected Eleanor Ashworth for sixty years.

"The case is more complicated than it appears."

"Cases always are." Reyes leaned back in her chair. "What I need to know is whether those complications are going to blow back on this department. On me."

"Honestly? I don't know yet."

She studied me for a long moment. Reyes had been my captain for fifteen years, my mentor before that. She knew my tells, my habits, the way I worked a case long after everyone else had moved on. She also knew when I was holding something back.

"Talk to me, James."

I took a breath. "Eleanor Ashworth didn't operate alone. For decades, she had help—people in positions of power who looked the other way, covered up her crimes, benefited from her influence. Some of those people are still in this town, still in their positions."

"You're talking about the old guard." Reyes's voice was flat. "The mayor's circle. The country club set."

"I'm talking about complicity in multiple felonies stretching back forty years. Murder. Extortion. Fraud. Evidence tampering." I met her eyes. "My grandmother was one of Eleanor's victims. So was a man named Marcus Webb, whose death was staged to look like an industrial accident."

"Your grandmother." Reyes's expression shifted—something vulnerable flickering behind the professional mask. "James, if this case involves your family—"

"It involves everyone's family. That's the point." I leaned forward. "Eleanor Ashworth built a system. A network of favors and threats and buried secrets that let her do whatever she wanted to whoever she wanted. And when she died, that network didn't die with her. It's still out there. Still functioning. Still protecting the people who helped her."

Reyes was quiet for a long moment. The clock on her wall ticked—one of those old railway station clocks, a gift from her father, she'd once told me. Outside, someone laughed—a normal sound from a normal day, utterly disconnected from what we were discussing. Through the window, I could see patrol officers heading out to their cruisers, the mundane rhythm of police work continuing regardless of what secrets we unearthed.

"You know who you're describing." Her voice was careful. "You know what happens if you start pulling on those threads."

"I know."

"Chief Morrison has been in his position for twenty-two years. Mayor Caldwell, nineteen. Judge Harper, the one who'll be handling Diana and Julian's cases—she's been on the bench since before you joined the force." Reyes shook her head slowly. "These are people with power, James. Real power. The kind that can make a detective's career disappear."

"Or make witnesses disappear. Or evidence. Or entire investigations."

"Yes." Reyes's jaw tightened. "Or those things too."

I thought about Rosa Martinez in her hospital bed, refusing to talk to anyone but me. About David Sterling, exhausted and finally willing to testify after decades of complicity. About Catherine Webb, dying of cancer, wanting the truth exposed before she was gone.

"What would you do?" I asked. "If you had evidence of systemic corruption—real evidence, the kind that could bring down half the power structure in this town—would you pursue it?"

Reyes stood and walked to the window. Her silhouette was dark against the afternoon light, her shoulders carrying the weight of questions she'd been asking herself for years.

"When I was a rookie," she said quietly, "I had a partner. Good cop. Honest. He stumbled onto something he shouldn't have—a connection between the Ashworth family and a land deal that had displaced two hundred families from their homes. He started asking questions."

"What happened to him?"

"Heart attack. Forty-three years old, no history of cardiac problems, dead at his desk one morning." She turned to face me. "The coroner ruled it natural causes. The investigation into the land deal was closed. And I learned a very important lesson about what questions were safe to ask in Millbrook."

"So you stopped asking."

"I survived." Her voice was hard, but I heard the crack beneath it. "I kept my head down, did my job, climbed the ladder. Told myself I was doing more good inside the system than I could do fighting it from outside." She met my eyes. "Maybe I was right. Maybe I was just a coward. Either way, here I am—twenty years later, and the same people are still in charge, still doing the same things, and I'm still pretending not to notice."

The weight of her confession settled over both of us. In fifteen years, Reyes had never spoken to me like this—had never let me see the compromises she'd made, the prices she'd paid to survive in a system built on silence.

"I have evidence," I said. "Documents, correspondence, financial records. Catherine Webb has been gathering it for forty years. My father has been helping her for the last five. There's enough to start a real investigation—not just into Eleanor's death, but into everything she did. Everything her network helped her do."

"Where is this evidence now?"

"Scattered. Catherine has most of it. Some is in my father's possession. Rosa Martinez collected her own files before she was attacked." I paused. "And David Sterling has offered to cooperate. Thirty-seven years as Eleanor's attorney—he knows where all the bodies are buried."

Reyes was silent for a long moment. Then she did something I'd never seen her do before: she sat down heavily, like the weight had finally become too much to carry standing.

"If you do this," she said, "there's no going back. You'll make enemies of people who have the power to destroy you. Your career, your reputation, maybe worse." She looked at me with something that might have been fear. "Are you prepared for that?"

"Eleanor Ashworth spent sixty years destroying people's lives because no one had the courage to stop her. My grandmother lived in terror until the day she died. Marcus Webb was murdered and erased like he never existed." I touched the pocket where his letter rested. "Someone has to say enough. Someone has to be willing to pull the whole rotten structure down, even if it means getting buried in the rubble."

"And that someone has to be you."

"I'm the only one who can be." I stood, feeling the decision settle into my bones like something inevitable. "I'm the detective on record. I have access to the investigation. And I'm the great-grandson of the man Eleanor murdered—which means I have a personal stake that won't let me walk away."

Reyes studied my face for a long moment. Whatever she saw there made her nod slowly, something like respect flickering in her eyes.

"You have forty-eight hours."

"What?"

"Forty-eight hours before Chief Morrison demands a full briefing on the Ashworth case. Before the lawyers start their motions and the media circus begins. Before everyone who's been hiding starts scrambling to cover their tracks." She stood, drawing herself up to her full height. "Whatever you're going to do, whatever evidence you're going to gather—you have forty-eight hours to do it. After that, this case goes through official channels, and I can't protect you anymore."

"Maria—"

"Don't." She held up a hand. "Don't thank me. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for my partner—the one who died asking questions I was too afraid to ask. I'm doing it for every case that got buried, every witness that got silenced, every cop who learned to look the other way because looking directly at the truth was too dangerous." Her voice cracked. "I'm doing it because I'm tired of being afraid."

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.

"Now get out of my office." Reyes turned back to the window. "And James? Be careful. The people you're about to go after—they've been playing this game a lot longer than you have."

---

I left the station as the sun was setting, painting the streets of Millbrook in shades of amber and shadow. My phone buzzed as I reached my car: a text from an unknown number.

*We need to talk. Ashworth marina. One hour.*

I stared at the message, running through possibilities. Catherine Webb, summoning me for another meeting? My father, with new information? Or something else—someone from Eleanor's network, trying to determine how much I knew?

Only one way to find out.

The marina was quiet when I arrived. Most of the boats had been pulled for the season, leaving rows of empty slips like missing teeth in a boxer's smile. The boathouse where I'd met the masked figure two nights ago sat dark and silent at the water's edge.

Sarah was waiting on the dock.

She sat on a bench facing the water, her hair loose around her shoulders, a cigarette burning between her fingers. I'd forgotten she smoked—or maybe she'd started again. Three years was long enough for people to change in ways you couldn't predict.

"James." She didn't turn as I approached. "Thank you for coming."

"The cryptic text messages aren't helping your credibility."

"I know." She took a drag from the cigarette, exhaled slowly. "I've spent so long hiding that I forgot how to do anything else. But you deserve the truth. All of it."

I sat beside her, maintaining distance. The water lapped against the dock, rhythmic and indifferent. Somewhere across the lake, a loon called—a sound so mournful it seemed to echo the ache in my chest.

"Victor called me this morning," Sarah said. "He told me what's happening. Diana's arrest, Julian's confession, the investigation expanding." She finally looked at me, and I saw fear in her eyes. "He told me you know about my connection to the family."

"I know you were blackmailing him. I know Eleanor destroyed your family twenty-three years ago. I know you kept all of it from me through our entire marriage."

"Yes." The word was barely a whisper. "All of that is true."

"Then explain to me why I should believe anything you say now."

Sarah was quiet for a long moment. The cigarette burned down between her fingers, ash drifting into the water.

"When I was twenty-two," she said finally, "I thought I understood how the world worked. You fall in love, you build a life, you grow old together. Simple. Obvious. The way it's supposed to be." She shook her head. "Then I fell in love with Victor Ashworth, and I learned that some people don't follow those rules. Some people—people like Eleanor—see love as a weakness to exploit, a tool to control, a threat to eliminate."

"She destroyed your family."

"She destroyed everything. My father, my brother, my sense of safety in the world." Sarah's voice cracked. "She paid me a hundred thousand dollars to disappear, and I took it because I didn't know what else to do. I was twenty-two years old, and the most powerful woman in Millbrook had just shown me that she could ruin anyone she wanted, anytime she wanted, and no one would stop her."

"So you ran."

"I survived." The same words Reyes had used. "I moved to Detroit, changed my name professionally, tried to build a new life. And for a while, it worked. I met you, I fell in love again—really fell, not the naive infatuation I'd felt for Victor. I thought maybe I could leave it all behind."

"But you couldn't."

"The money ran out. My father's Alzheimer's care, my brother's rehab, my mother's medical bills—it all added up. And I realized I had something Eleanor's family still wanted to keep hidden." Sarah crushed out the cigarette. "So I reached out to Victor. Not blackmail, exactly—I told myself I was just asking for what I was owed. Compensation for what Eleanor had taken. But we both know what it really was."

"You were extorting money from a man whose mother had already paid you to go away."

"Yes." Sarah met my eyes. "I was doing what Eleanor taught me to do. Using leverage, exploiting weakness, taking what I needed to survive. I became a version of the thing I hated."

I sat with that, feeling the weight of it. Sarah wasn't wrong. Eleanor Ashworth had spent her whole life creating people like Sarah—people who learned that the world was cruel and decided to be cruel in return. A legacy of damage, spreading outward like ripples in dark water.

"Why didn't you tell me?" I asked. "When we were married—why didn't you trust me with the truth?"

"Because I found out about your grandmother." Sarah's voice was barely audible. "After your grandmother died, I was helping you sort through her things. I found letters, a diary, documents she'd hidden. And I realized that your family was connected to Eleanor too. That the Ashworths had destroyed your grandmother the same way they'd destroyed my family."

"And you didn't think I deserved to know that?"

"I thought telling you would put you in danger." Tears were streaming down Sarah's face now. "Eleanor was still alive then. Still watching, still controlling. If she found out I was married to a detective whose grandmother she'd targeted—if she realized you might start asking questions about the past—" Sarah broke off, shaking her head. "I convinced myself I was protecting you. Keeping you separate from the darkness I'd been pulled into. But maybe I was just being a coward. Maybe I was just too scared to face the truth myself."

I thought about my father's words at the cemetery. *Eleanor made people afraid to tell the truth. So they lied to survive, and the lies became habit, and eventually nobody could tell the difference between who they really were and who they'd become to protect themselves.*

Sarah had been living in that shadow for twenty-three years. Hiding, adapting, becoming something she never wanted to be—all because one woman had decided to destroy her life for the crime of falling in love.

"What do you want, Sarah? Why did you ask me here?"

She wiped her eyes and took a breath, steadying herself. "Because I have something you need. Something that could help you bring down the whole network."

"What kind of something?"

"Victor told me what Diana found. Documents, financial records, evidence of Eleanor's crimes hidden somewhere in the estate." Sarah met my eyes. "What Diana didn't know—what nobody knows—is that Eleanor kept copies. Off-site backups, stored in a safety deposit box at First National Bank."

"How do you know about this?"

"Because I spent three years getting close to Victor, learning everything he knew about his mother's operations." Sarah's smile was bitter. "I told myself I was gathering insurance—something to protect myself if Eleanor ever came after me again. But the truth is, part of me always wanted this. Wanted to find enough evidence to burn her empire to the ground."

"And you never used it."

"I was too afraid. As long as Eleanor was alive, using that evidence would have been suicide. But now—" Sarah reached into her jacket and pulled out a small key. "Safety deposit box 1247. First National Bank, main branch. Eleanor's name is on the account, but she gave Victor access years ago—and Victor gave me a copy of the key when we were together."

I stared at the key, small and ordinary, holding the potential to change everything.

"Why are you giving this to me?"

"Because you're the only person who can use it. You're a detective. You have standing to request access, to log the evidence properly, to make sure it can be used in court." Sarah pressed the key into my palm. "And because I owe you. For the lies, for the years of pretending, for everything I took from you when I left. This won't make up for any of that—but it's all I have left to give."

I closed my fingers around the key. It was warm from her hand, solid and real in a way that nothing else had felt for days.

"Sarah, if I open that box, I have to document everything I find. Including where the key came from, including your involvement in the blackmail scheme."

"I know."

"You could be charged. Accessory after the fact, at minimum. Maybe worse, depending on what's in there."

"I know that too." Sarah stood, pulling her jacket tight against the evening chill. "I've spent twenty-three years running from what Eleanor did to me. Hiding, lying, surviving. I'm tired, James. Whatever happens next—whatever price I have to pay—at least it'll be over."

She turned to leave, then paused.

"James? For what it's worth—I did love you. Not at first, maybe. At first, I was too damaged to love anyone. But somewhere along the way, it became real." Her voice caught. "I'm sorry I couldn't be honest with you. I'm sorry I couldn't be the person you deserved."

"Sarah—"

"Don't." She held up a hand. "Don't say it's okay, because it's not. Don't say you forgive me, because you shouldn't have to. Just do what you need to do. Bring them all down. Make it mean something."

She walked away into the gathering darkness. I watched until she disappeared, then looked down at the key in my hand.

Forty-eight hours. A safety deposit box full of evidence. A network of corruption that had protected Eleanor Ashworth for six decades.

The pieces were coming together. The trap was being laid.

Still, I knew, with a certainty that settled cold in my gut, that the people I was hunting would not go quietly. They had survived this long by destroying anyone who threatened them. They would come for me the moment they realized what I was doing.

I needed to move fast. Tomorrow morning, I would be at First National Bank when the doors opened. And whatever I found in box 1247 would determine whether Eleanor Ashworth's legacy finally burned—or whether her network swallowed me whole.

The loon called again across the water, its cry echoing into the night. I walked back to my car, the key clutched tight in my fist, and drove toward whatever came next.
