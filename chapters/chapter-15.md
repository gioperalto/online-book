# The Fourth Hand

Margot Ashworth looked different than she had at the estate. Gone was the fragile demeanor, the nervous energy that had made her seem like a bird ready to take flight at any sudden movement. In the dim light of my kitchen, she appeared solid, present—a woman who had finally stopped pretending.

"You're not supposed to leave the estate." I kept my weapon at my side but didn't holster it. "The police—"

"The police have bigger problems tonight than keeping track of me." Margot set the photograph down carefully. "I heard about Morrison and Caldwell. About the FBI. Your Captain Reyes called to inform my brother that the investigation was expanding." A thin smile crossed her face. "Victor was not pleased."

"How did you get in here?"

"Your back door has a broken latch. You should have it fixed." She nodded toward the chair across from her. "Please, Detective. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm here because I finally remembered something—something I should have told you days ago."

I hesitated, then holstered my weapon and sat. The kitchen table between us felt like a gulf, years of secrets and lies piled up like rubble.

"You said Eleanor didn't kill herself."

"She didn't." Margot's voice was steady, certain. "I've been going over that night in my head, again and again, trying to understand what I saw. And I finally realized what was wrong with my memory—what I'd been blocking out."

"Tell me."

Margot closed her eyes. When she spoke, her words came slowly, each one dragged up from some deep, buried place.

"I told you I went to the library around midnight. That I found Eleanor slumped over, barely conscious. That I saw someone strangling her and fled before they could see me." She opened her eyes. "All of that was true. But it wasn't the whole truth."

I waited. The clock on my wall ticked its steady rhythm.

"After the strangler ran—after Julian fled through the garden door—I didn't leave immediately. I stayed. Hidden behind the heavy curtains near the window, too terrified to move." Margot's hands trembled slightly as she clasped them together on the table. "I saw what happened next."

"Someone else came into the library."

"Yes." The word was barely a whisper. "I thought it was over. I thought Eleanor was dying, that no one else would come. But then I heard footsteps—slow, deliberate footsteps coming from the hallway. Not rushed like Julian's had been. Careful."

"Could you see who it was?"

"Not at first. The library was dark—only the desk lamp was on, casting shadows everywhere. But then the figure moved to Eleanor's desk, and I saw—" Margot's breath caught. "I saw them pick up the letter opener."

The room seemed to contract around me. "Someone else stabbed Eleanor. Not Eleanor herself."

"I watched them do it." Tears were streaming down Margot's face now. "Eleanor was still alive—barely, but alive. Her eyes were open. I think she even recognized the person standing over her. And then they—" She couldn't finish.

"Who was it, Margot? Who killed your mother?"

Margot looked at me, and in her eyes I saw something that went beyond fear. It was the hollow, haunted look of someone who had witnessed something that had broken a fundamental part of their understanding of the world.

"It was David Sterling."

---

The name hit me like a physical blow. David Sterling—Eleanor's attorney of thirty-seven years. The man who had helped cover up Marcus Webb's murder, who had drafted the documents that kept Eleanor's network hidden, who had cooperated so willingly when I'd questioned him about the night of Eleanor's death.

"You're certain?"

"I'd know his face anywhere." Margot wiped her tears with the back of her hand. "He was my godfather, Detective. He held me when I was baptized. He came to every birthday party, every graduation. He sat across from me at countless family dinners while my mother poisoned everything good in our lives." Her voice hardened. "And he was the one who drove the letter opener into her chest."

"Why didn't you tell me this before?"

"Because I didn't remember. I didn't want to remember." Margot's laugh was bitter, hollow. "Do you have any idea what it's like to watch someone you've known your entire life commit murder? My mind just—shut down. Blocked it out. Replaced it with a story that made more sense: Eleanor killed herself, a final act of control. That's what everyone wanted to believe anyway."

I thought about Sterling's confession—how willingly he'd admitted to decades of complicity in Eleanor's crimes. How cooperative he'd been, offering information about the network, about Eleanor's operations. It had seemed like the unburdening of a guilty conscience.

But what if it had been something else entirely? What if Sterling had been confessing to the smaller crimes to distract from the larger one?

"He's been playing me." The words tasted like ash. "This whole time, he's been feeding me information, acting like a reluctant witness finally telling the truth. And all along—"

"All along, he was the one who finished it." Margot leaned forward. "But here's what I don't understand, Detective. Why? My mother trusted Sterling completely. He was one of the only people in the world she actually trusted. What could possibly make him turn on her like that?"

The question hung in the air between us. I thought about everything Sterling had told me—about the phone call from Robert Marlowe that had terrified Eleanor, about the changes to the will, about the network's operations.

And then I remembered something else. Something Sterling had said during our last conversation.

*Eleanor asked me to prepare a new will. One that would cut out everyone—Victor, Julian, even the charities. She wanted to burn the family to the ground.*

"The will." I stood up, the pieces suddenly clicking into place. "Sterling said Eleanor was going to change her will again—to disinherit everyone. But he also said she died before signing it."

"That's right. The old will is still in effect. Victor gets sixty percent, Julian gets his trust—"

"And Sterling?" I interrupted. "What does Sterling get?"

Margot's face went pale. "I—I don't know. I never thought to ask. Mother's will has been revised so many times over the years, I stopped keeping track."

"I need to see the current will. The one that's actually in effect."

"It's at Sterling's office. He has all the originals."

I grabbed my jacket from the back of the chair. "Come with me. You're going to give a formal statement about what you saw."

"Detective—" Margot hesitated. "There's something else. Something Sterling said to my mother before he—before it happened."

"What?"

"He said: 'I've given you thirty-seven years, Eleanor. Thirty-seven years of my life, my conscience, my soul. And this is how you repay me? This is my reward?'" Margot's voice shook. "And my mother—dying, poisoned, just strangled by her own grandson—she laughed at him. She actually laughed and said, 'You were never anything but a tool, David. Tools don't get rewarded. They get replaced.'"

---

The drive to Sterling's office took fifteen minutes. Margot sat in the passenger seat, her hands folded tightly in her lap, staring out at the dark streets of Millbrook. The town looked peaceful at this hour—quiet houses, sleeping families, ordinary lives untouched by the rot that had been growing at its center for decades.

I called Captain Reyes on the way, keeping my voice level as I explained what Margot had revealed.

"Sterling? Are you sure about this, Marlowe?"

"Margot witnessed it. She's ready to give a formal statement."

"Jesus Christ." Reyes was quiet for a moment. "Sterling's been cooperating with the FBI. He's supposed to testify against the network at tomorrow's operation."

"Then the FBI needs to know their star witness is also their primary murder suspect."

"I'll call Torres. She'll want to handle this herself." Reyes paused. "Marlowe—be careful. If Sterling killed Eleanor, he's got nothing left to lose. A man like that is dangerous."

"I know."

Sterling's office was in a converted Victorian house on Oak Street, two blocks from the courthouse. The building was dark when we pulled up, the windows reflecting the amber glow of street lamps. Sterling's car—a silver Mercedes—sat in the small parking lot behind the building.

"He's here." I checked my weapon. "Stay in the car."

"Detective—"

"Stay in the car, Margot. If anything happens, you drive away and call 911."

I didn't wait for her response. I crossed the parking lot quickly, staying low, watching the windows for any sign of movement. The back door of the office was unlocked—never a good sign.

Inside, the building smelled like old paper and leather. Sterling's office was on the second floor, accessible by a narrow staircase that creaked under my weight. I climbed slowly, weapon drawn, ears straining for any sound.

The door to Sterling's office was ajar. Light spilled out into the hallway, accompanied by the soft clink of ice against glass.

"Come in, Detective Marlowe." Sterling's voice was calm, almost friendly. "I've been expecting you."

I pushed the door open. Sterling sat behind his massive oak desk, a crystal tumbler of whiskey in his hand. He looked composed, relaxed—a man who had made peace with something.

"Margot remembered," he said. It wasn't a question.

"You killed Eleanor Ashworth."

"I finished what the others started." Sterling took a sip of his whiskey. "Diana poisoned her. Julian strangled her. All I did was end her suffering." He smiled thinly. "Call it a mercy killing."

"That's not how the law sees it."

"The law." Sterling laughed, the sound hollow and bitter. "I spent thirty-seven years helping Eleanor Ashworth circumvent the law. I drafted documents that made murders look like accidents. I filed papers that buried evidence. I sat in this very office and watched her destroy lives, families, entire communities—and I did nothing. Less than nothing. I helped." He set the glass down on his desk. "So please, Detective, don't lecture me about the law."

"Why?" I kept my weapon trained on him. "Why did you do it? After all those years, after everything you helped her do—why kill her that night?"

Sterling was quiet for a long moment. The clock on his wall—an antique grandfather clock that had probably cost more than my car—ticked away the seconds.

"Because she was going to destroy me too." He reached slowly into his desk drawer—I tensed, but he withdrew only a folded document. "Do you know what this is?"

"The will."

"Not just any will. This is the will Eleanor intended to sign the night she died. The one that would have cut out her entire family." Sterling unfolded it and held it up. "Would you like to know what it says about me?"

"Tell me."

"For thirty-seven years, I had an arrangement with Eleanor. In exchange for my... services, I would receive a bequest upon her death. Not the largest share, but substantial—three million dollars and the deed to a property in Maine where I'd hoped to retire." Sterling's jaw tightened. "This new will—the one she was going to sign—eliminated that arrangement entirely. Zero dollars. Zero property. And a clause explicitly stating that I was being removed for 'services no longer meeting expectations.'"

"So you killed her for money."

"I killed her because she used me up and threw me away like garbage." Sterling's voice rose, the first crack in his composure. "Thirty-seven years. I gave her thirty-seven years of my life, my career, my morality. I could have been anything—a judge, a partner at a major firm, a respected member of this community. Instead, I became Eleanor Ashworth's errand boy. Her fixer. Her accomplice." He picked up his glass again, hand trembling. "And when I was no longer useful, she discarded me. No gratitude. No loyalty. Just cold calculation, the way she treated everyone."

"So you waited until she was dying—poisoned and strangled—and you finished the job."

"I made a decision. If Eleanor died before signing the new will, the old one would remain in effect. I would get my bequest. I would have something to show for those thirty-seven wasted years." Sterling drained his glass. "Call it survival instinct. Call it revenge. Call it whatever you want. But don't pretend you wouldn't have done the same."

"I'm not like you."

"No?" Sterling smiled, and there was something knowing in it, something that made my skin crawl. "You're investigating the murder of a woman who destroyed your grandmother, killed your great-grandfather, and controlled this town for sixty years. And you've been doing it by the book, playing by the rules, pretending that justice actually exists." He shook his head. "Deep down, Detective, you're glad she's dead. We all are. The only difference is that I had the courage to do something about it."

I heard sirens in the distance—Reyes must have dispatched backup. Sterling heard them too, and something shifted in his expression.

"The FBI operation tomorrow night," I said. "You were supposed to testify. To help bring down the network."

"I still can. I have evidence, Detective. Thirty-seven years of evidence—documents, recordings, photographs. Enough to put a dozen people in prison for the rest of their lives." Sterling leaned forward. "Including the adjuster."

The name sent a chill through me. "You know who the adjuster is?"

"I know everything. I was Eleanor's right hand for almost four decades. I attended meetings, facilitated payments, drafted contracts." Sterling's eyes were bright now, feverish. "Let me testify tomorrow. Let me help you bring them all down. And in exchange—"

"In exchange, what? You walk free?"

"I accept responsibility for what I did to Eleanor. I'll plead guilty to whatever charge you want. But let me finish what I started. Let me help you destroy the network that Eleanor built." Sterling spread his hands. "It's the only good thing I've done in thirty-seven years. Don't take it away from me now."

The sirens were closer now, red and blue lights painting the windows.

"That's not my decision to make," I said. "That's for the FBI and the district attorney."

Sterling nodded slowly. "Then I suppose we'll find out together what kind of justice this system actually delivers."

---

They took Sterling into custody just before 3 AM. Agent Torres—Margaret—arrived with a team of FBI agents, her face unreadable as she watched him being led out in handcuffs. When she caught my eye, she nodded once—a silent acknowledgment that the case had just gotten more complicated.

Margot gave her formal statement at the station, her voice steady as she recounted what she'd witnessed. Diana's poisoning. Julian's strangulation. And Sterling's final, fatal thrust of the letter opener.

Three hands had touched Eleanor Ashworth's death. Four, if you counted Eleanor herself—because the medical examiner had been right about one thing. The angle of the wound was consistent with self-infliction. Sterling had positioned the letter opener, but Eleanor, in her final moment of consciousness, had grabbed his hand and helped drive it home.

Even dying, she had wanted to control the ending.

"She chose it," Margot said quietly, after the formal interview was over. "Even with Diana's poison in her veins and Julian's fingerprints on her throat and Sterling's hand on the weapon—she still found a way to make it her decision."

"Some people can't let go of control. Even at the end."

"No." Margot looked at me with those haunted eyes. "Some people are so afraid of anyone else having power over them that they'd rather die by their own hand than let someone else take credit."

I thought about my grandmother, who had lived her whole life under Eleanor's shadow. About Marcus Webb, murdered because he dared to love the wrong woman. About Catherine Webb, spending decades gathering evidence while cancer ate her from the inside. About Margaret—Agent Torres—sacrificing thirty years of her life to infiltrate and destroy the network from within.

So many lives, twisted and broken by one woman's need for control.

And now, finally, it was ending.

---

Dawn was breaking when I finally left the station. The sky over Millbrook was turning pink and gold, the first light of a new day touching the sleeping town. In a few hours, everything would be different. The arrests of Morrison and Caldwell had already made the morning news. By tonight, if the warehouse operation succeeded, the entire network would be exposed.

But as I walked to my car, my phone buzzed with a new message. Unknown number.

*The meeting tonight is a trap. Sterling talked before you arrested him. They know you're coming.*

I stared at the screen, my blood running cold. If the network knew about the operation—if they were expecting us—

Another message appeared.

*The adjuster is already in Millbrook. He's been here since yesterday. And he's not coming to the warehouse.*

My hands were shaking as I typed: *Where is he?*

The response came immediately.

*Where do you think? He's tying up loose ends. The witnesses. The evidence. Everyone who can testify.*

I thought about Catherine Webb, frail and dying. About Rosa Martinez in her hospital bed. About my father at the cemetery.

*Who's the target?*

The phone rang. I answered without thinking.

"Detective Marlowe." The voice was distorted, mechanical—the same voice from the chapel attack. But this time, there was something different in it. Something urgent. "Listen very carefully. The adjuster's first target is your father. He's at the old Webb property on the outskirts of town—the house where Marcus grew up. He went there this morning to retrieve something Catherine told him about."

"How do you know this?"

"Because I've been tracking the adjuster for fifteen years. He's the one loose end I could never tie up. The one piece of Eleanor's network I could never identify." The voice paused. "But I know his methods. And I know he's going to eliminate everyone connected to the Webb family before disappearing forever."

"Who are you?"

"You already know." The mechanical distortion faded, and I heard Margaret's voice—Agent Torres, my aunt. "I've been protecting this family my whole life, James. But I can't be everywhere. I need you to get to your father before the adjuster does. Can you do that?"

"Yes."

"Then go. Now." The line went dead.

I was running before I even made the conscious decision. Throwing myself into the car, gunning the engine, tearing through the quiet streets of Millbrook toward the edge of town.

My father. The adjuster. The house where Marcus Webb had grown up, before Eleanor Ashworth had stolen his life.

THEREFORE the final pieces were falling into place, and the ghost I'd been chasing through decades of secrets was finally about to show its face.
