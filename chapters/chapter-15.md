# A Fourth Hand Revealed

Margot Ashworth looked different than she had at the estate. Gone was the fragile demeanor, the nervous energy that had made her seem like a bird ready to take flight at any sudden movement. In the dim light of my kitchen, she appeared solid, present—a woman who had finally stopped pretending.

"You're not supposed to leave the estate." I kept my weapon at my side but didn't holster it. "The police—"

"The police have bigger problems tonight than keeping track of me." Margot set the photograph down carefully. "I heard about Morrison and Caldwell. About the FBI. Your captain called to inform my brother that the investigation was expanding." A thin smile crossed her face. "Victor was not pleased."

"How did you get in here?"

"Your back door has a broken latch. You should have it fixed." She nodded toward the chair across from her. "Please, Detective. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm here because I finally remembered something—something I should have told you days ago."

I hesitated, then holstered my weapon and sat. The kitchen table between us felt like a gulf, years of secrets and lies piled up like rubble.

"You said Eleanor didn't kill herself."

"She didn't." Margot's voice was steady, certain. "I've been going over that night in my head, again and again, trying to understand what I saw. And I finally realized what was wrong with my memory—what I'd been blocking out."

"Tell me."

Margot closed her eyes. When she spoke, her words came slowly, each one dragged up from some deep, buried place.

"I told you I went to the library around midnight. That I found Eleanor slumped over, barely conscious. That I saw someone strangling her and fled before they could see me." She opened her eyes. "All of that was true. But it wasn't the whole truth."

I waited. The clock on my wall ticked its steady rhythm.

"After the strangler ran—after Julian fled through the garden door—I didn't leave immediately. I stayed. Hidden behind the heavy curtains near the window, too terrified to move." Margot's hands trembled slightly as she clasped them together on the table. "I saw what happened next."

"Someone else came into the library."

"Yes." The word was barely a whisper. "I thought it was over. I thought Eleanor was dying, that no one else would come. But then I heard footsteps—slow, deliberate footsteps coming from the hallway. Not rushed like Julian's had been. Careful."

"Could you see who it was?"

"Not at first. The library was dark—only the desk lamp was on, casting shadows everywhere. But then the figure moved to Eleanor's desk, and I saw—" Margot's breath caught. "I saw them pick up the letter opener."

The room seemed to contract around me. "Someone else stabbed Eleanor. Not Eleanor herself."

"I watched them do it." Tears were streaming down Margot's face now. "Eleanor was still alive—barely, but alive. Her eyes were open. I think she even recognized the person standing over her. And then they—" She couldn't finish.

"Who was it, Margot? Who killed your mother?"

Margot looked at me, and in her eyes I saw something that went beyond fear. It was the hollow, haunted look of someone who had witnessed something that had broken a fundamental part of their understanding of the world.

"It was David Sterling."

---

The drive to Sterling's office took fifteen minutes. Margot sat in the passenger seat, her hands folded tightly in her lap, staring out at the dark streets of Millbrook. The town looked peaceful at this hour—quiet houses, sleeping families, ordinary lives untouched by the rot that had been growing at its center for decades.

I called Captain Reyes on the way, keeping my voice level as I explained what Margot had revealed.

"Sterling? Are you sure about this, Marlowe?"

"Margot witnessed it. She's ready to give a formal statement."

"Jesus Christ." Reyes was quiet for a moment. "Sterling's been cooperating with the FBI. He's supposed to testify against the network at tomorrow's operation."

"Then the FBI needs to know their star witness is also their primary murder suspect."

"I'll call Torres. She'll want to handle this herself." Reyes paused. "Marlowe—be careful. If Sterling killed Eleanor, he's got nothing left to lose. A man like that is dangerous."

"I know."

Sterling's office was in a converted Victorian house on Oak Street, two blocks from the courthouse. The building was dark when we pulled up, the windows reflecting the amber glow of street lamps. Sterling's car—a silver Mercedes—sat in the small parking lot behind the building.

"He's here." I checked my weapon. "Stay in the car."

"Detective—"

"Stay in the car, Margot. If anything happens, you drive away and call 911."

I didn't wait for her response. I crossed the parking lot quickly, staying low, watching the windows for any sign of movement. The back door of the office was unlocked—never a good sign.

Inside, the building smelled like old paper and leather. Sterling's office was on the second floor, accessible by a narrow staircase that creaked under my weight. I climbed slowly, weapon drawn, ears straining for any sound.

The door to Sterling's office was ajar. Light spilled out into the hallway, accompanied by the soft clink of ice against glass.

"Come in, Detective Marlowe." Sterling's voice was calm, almost friendly.

I pushed the door open. Sterling sat behind his massive oak desk, a crystal tumbler of whiskey in his hand. He looked composed, relaxed—a man who had made peace with something.

"Margot remembered," he said. It wasn't a question.

"You killed Eleanor Ashworth."

Sterling set down his glass. The ice clinked once, then settled. His expression didn't change, but something behind his eyes shifted—not guilt, not fear, but something closer to exhaustion.

"No, Detective. I did not."

"I have an eyewitness."

"Your eye witness doesn't have the full story." Sterling's voice remained measured, as though he were explaining a particularly tedious legal precedent.

I kept my weapon trained on him. "Explain."

Sterling rose slowly, hands visible, and moved to the window. The amber streetlight cast deep shadows across his face, making him look older than his sixty-two years. He had the look of a man who had been carrying something heavy for a very long time.

"I heard the commotion from my room. Footsteps, a door slamming, then silence—the kind of silence that isn't natural at that hour. I went to the library." He paused, staring at something beyond the glass. "Eleanor was slumped in her chair. The poison had already done its work—she was barely conscious, gasping. The marks on her throat were fresh. Whoever had strangled her had fled, but they'd done the job thoroughly enough."

"And you just happened to find her."

"I found her dying, Detective. There's a difference." Sterling turned to face me. "She recognized me. Despite everything—the poison clouding her mind, the damage to her throat—she knew who I was. And she spoke."

"What did she say?"

Sterling's jaw tightened. "She said: 'Don't the new will. Promise me, David. Promise me.'"

The words hung in the air between us. I thought about the unsigned document, the one that would have disinherited Victor entirely and given everything to Julian.

"She changed her mind."

"In the end, yes." Sterling returned to his chair, lowering himself into it as though his bones ached. "Thirty-seven years I served that woman. Thirty-seven years of watching her control, manipulate, destroy anyone who stood in her way. And in her final moments, with death closing in, she chose to protect the very children she'd spent her life tormenting."

"That doesn't explain the letter opener."

Sterling closed his eyes. When he opened them again, they were wet.

"She asked me to end it. The poison was slow—she would have suffered for hours. The strangulation had crushed her windpipe but hadn't finished the job. She was drowning in her own blood, Detective, and she grabbed my hand and put the letter opener in it and she begged me." His voice cracked. "Eleanor Ashworth never begged for anything in her life. But she begged me to end her suffering."

"So you did."

"I helped her guide the blade. Her hand on mine, choosing the angle, choosing the moment." Sterling wiped his eyes with the back of his hand—an oddly vulnerable gesture from a man who had seemed so composed moments before. "She wanted to control even her own death. Even at the very end."

I didn't lower my weapon, but something in my certainty had begun to erode. Margot had seen what she'd seen, but darkness and fear and distance could twist perception. And Sterling's account matched the medical examiner's findings—the angle consistent with self-infliction.

"Why should I believe you?"

Sterling laughed, but there was no humor in it. "You shouldn't. I'm a lawyer, Detective. Lying is what we do." He picked up his glass again, swirling the remaining whiskey. "But I'll tell you something I've never told anyone. Eleanor Ashworth was the closest thing to a mother I ever had."

The confession caught me off guard. I said nothing, waiting.

"My own mother died when I was seven. Father drank himself to death by the time I was fourteen. I put myself through law school working nights at a warehouse, and when I graduated, I had nothing—no connections, no family name, no future." Sterling's voice had gone distant, lost in memory. "Eleanor found me. Saw something in me. She paid off my student loans, set me up in this practice, introduced me to every person who mattered in this town. She made me."

"She also made you complicit in decades of criminal activity."

"Yes. And I went along willingly, because I owed her everything and because—" He stopped, struggling with something. "Because she needed me. Her own children were weak. Victor was just like his father. Margot, so fragile she shattered every time Eleanor looked at her wrong. Julian, smart enough but soft, more interested in sea creatures than in protecting his family's legacy."

Sterling's lip curled with something close to contempt.

"Eleanor needed instruments, Detective. People who could execute her vision, protect her interests, keep the wolves from the door. Her children couldn't be those instruments. They didn't have the steel for it. So she turned to me." He drained the last of his whiskey. "In this business, you have to be tough. Sharks are always circling—competitors, prosecutors, journalists, anyone who smells blood in the water. Eleanor kept them at bay for sixty years. She protected this family from threats they never even knew existed. And now she's gone, and those sharks are going to tear the Ashworths apart."

I heard the admiration in his voice, even now. Even after everything.

"You loved her."

"I respected her. I served her. Maybe even feared her." Sterling set the empty glass down. "Love is too simple a word for what Eleanor Ashworth inspired in me."

Sterling was quiet for a long moment. The grandfather clock ticked its steady rhythm. When he spoke again, his voice had changed—harder, more focused.

"Who told her I was there that night?"

I kept my expression neutral, but my mind was racing. Margot had been so certain, so composed when she'd arrived at my kitchen. Gone was the fragile demeanor. She'd known exactly what to say and how to say it.

"I'm not going to reveal my sources."

"Detective." Sterling leaned forward, and for the first time I saw something like fear in his eyes. "If someone is feeding you information and pointing you toward me as the killer—that someone has an agenda. And if that agenda involves framing me for Eleanor's murder while the real orchestrators escape justice, then you need to tell me who it is."

"I can't do that."

"Can't, or won't?"

I thought about Margot sitting in my car outside, her hands folded in her lap, waiting. If Sterling was telling the truth. If he hadn't murdered Eleanor, but instead helped end her suffering, then my assumptions were wrong. And if Sterling truly hated Eleanor's children for their weakness, what would he do if he learned it was Margot who had come forward?

"Won't."

Sterling studied me for a long moment. Then he nodded slowly, as though he'd confirmed something he'd already suspected.

"You're protecting someone. One of Eleanor's children, I assume. Margot, most likely." His jaw tightened. "I understand loyalty, Detective. But understand this: there's a chance you're being manipulated."

I holstered my weapon. Sterling wasn't a flight risk, and if his story was true, he wasn't a murderer—at least not in the way Margot had claimed.

"Stay in Millbrook," I said. "Don't leave town."

"I've been in Millbrook for thirty-seven years, Detective. I'm not going anywhere."

---

I stepped outside to find Margot still in the passenger seat, her face pale in the streetlight. She searched my expression as I approached the car.

"Well?"

"He tells a different story." I didn't elaborate. "I'm taking you back to the estate."

The drive was silent. I dropped Margot at the gates, where a uniformed officer was still stationed, and watched her walk up the long driveway toward the dark mansion. She didn't look back.

I called Reyes from the car.

"Sterling's story doesn't match Margot's," I said. "He claims Eleanor asked him to end her suffering. Says she changed her mind about the new will at the last moment, told him not to file it."

"You believe him?"

"I don't know what I believe. But I want him detained until we can verify his account. He's not a flight risk, but if he's involved in this—either as a killer or as a witness to who really was—I don't want him talking to the wrong people."

"I'll send someone to pick him up. Marlowe—" Reyes hesitated. "You sound like hell. When's the last time you slept?"

"I'll sleep when this is over."

I was still parked outside the Ashworth estate gates when my phone buzzed. Unknown number. The screen glowed in the darkness:

*The Adjuster is in town. He's here to tie up loose ends. Be careful who you trust.*

My hands tightened on the wheel. I typed back: *Who is this?*

No response.

I stared at the message, reading it again. The Adjuster. The ghost who had haunted this case from the beginning, the professional cleaner who made murders look like accidents.

Loose ends.

My mind went first to myself. To Rosa, unconscious in a hospital bed after the attack at the chapel. Someone had already tried to silence her once.

Then to my family.

Catherine. My father.

The thought unsettleed me. Catherine was dying of cancer, barely mobile, spending her final days gathering evidence against Eleanor. And my father—

I called Reyes again. "I need you to double the security on Rosa Martinez's room at Millbrook General. Now."

"Marlowe, what's going on?"

"Just do it. I'll explain later."

I hung up before she could argue and dialed Catherine's number. She answered on the third ring, her voice thin but alert.

"James. It's late."

"Where are you?"

"At my hotel. Why?"

"And my father? Where is he?"

A pause. When Catherine spoke again, her voice had gone careful. "I sent him to collect something for me. Documents I couldn't transport myself. They're at Marcus's old residence—the house where he grew up, before Eleanor had him transferred to Seattle."

My blood went cold. Marcus Webb's childhood home. The place where the whole tragedy had started, sixty years ago.

"Catherine, how long ago did he leave?"

"About an hour. James, what's wrong?"

I was already turning the key in the ignition, the engine roaring to life.

"Stay at the hotel. Lock your door. Don't open it for anyone."

"James—"

"Promise me."

"I promise. But tell me what's happening."

I couldn't. I didn't have words for the fear that was clawing up my throat, the certainty that I was already too late. The Adjuster was in Millbrook, tying up loose ends. And my father, the biological son of Marcus Webb, was alone in the very place this all started.

"I'll call you when it's over."

I hung up and gunned the engine, tearing through the empty streets of Millbrook toward the eastern edge of town. The old Webb place sat on three acres of overgrown property, a Victorian farmhouse that had been empty for decades. I'd never been there. I knew of Marcus Webb and the tragedy that befell him. Not as my grandfather who lost his life far too early.

But now my father was there, alone, and somewhere in the darkness, the Adjuster was hunting.

The final pieces were falling into place, and the ghost I'd been chasing through decades of secrets was finally about to show its face. History wasn't going to repeat itself if I could help it.
