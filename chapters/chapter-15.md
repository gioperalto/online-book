# A Fourth Hand Revealed

Margot Ashworth looked different than she had at the estate. Gone was the fragile demeanor, the nervous energy that had made her seem like a bird ready to take flight at any sudden movement. In the dim light of my kitchen, she appeared solid, present—a woman who had finally stopped pretending.

"You're not supposed to leave the estate." I kept my weapon at my side but didn't holster it. "The police—"

"The police have bigger problems tonight than keeping track of me." Margot set the photograph down carefully. "I heard about Morrison and Caldwell. About the FBI. Your Captain Reyes called to inform my brother that the investigation was expanding." A thin smile crossed her face. "Victor was not pleased."

"How did you get in here?"

"Your back door has a broken latch. You should have it fixed." She nodded toward the chair across from her. "Please, Detective. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm here because I finally remembered something—something I should have told you days ago."

I hesitated, then holstered my weapon and sat. The kitchen table between us felt like a gulf, years of secrets and lies piled up like rubble.

"You said Eleanor didn't kill herself."

"She didn't." Margot's voice was steady, certain. "I've been going over that night in my head, again and again, trying to understand what I saw. And I finally realized what was wrong with my memory—what I'd been blocking out."

"Tell me."

Margot closed her eyes. When she spoke, her words came slowly, each one dragged up from some deep, buried place.

"I told you I went to the library around midnight. That I found Eleanor slumped over, barely conscious. That I saw someone strangling her and fled before they could see me." She opened her eyes. "All of that was true. But it wasn't the whole truth."

I waited. The clock on my wall ticked its steady rhythm.

"After the strangler ran—after Julian fled through the garden door—I didn't leave immediately. I stayed. Hidden behind the heavy curtains near the window, too terrified to move." Margot's hands trembled slightly as she clasped them together on the table. "I saw what happened next."

"Someone else came into the library."

"Yes." The word was barely a whisper. "I thought it was over. I thought Eleanor was dying, that no one else would come. But then I heard footsteps—slow, deliberate footsteps coming from the hallway. Not rushed like Julian's had been. Careful."

"Could you see who it was?"

"Not at first. The library was dark—only the desk lamp was on, casting shadows everywhere. But then the figure moved to Eleanor's desk, and I saw—" Margot's breath caught. "I saw them pick up the letter opener."

The room seemed to contract around me. "Someone else stabbed Eleanor. Not Eleanor herself."

"I watched them do it." Tears were streaming down Margot's face now. "Eleanor was still alive—barely, but alive. Her eyes were open. I think she even recognized the person standing over her. And then they—" She couldn't finish.

"Who was it, Margot? Who killed your mother?"

Margot looked at me, and in her eyes I saw something that went beyond fear. It was the hollow, haunted look of someone who had witnessed something that had broken a fundamental part of their understanding of the world.

"It was David Sterling."

---

The name landed with the weight of a verdict. David Sterling—Eleanor's attorney of thirty-seven years. The man who had helped cover up Marcus Webb's murder, who had drafted the documents that kept Eleanor's network hidden, who had cooperated so willingly when I'd questioned him about the night of Eleanor's death.

"You're certain?"

"I'd know his face anywhere." Margot wiped her tears with the back of her hand. "He was my godfather, Detective. He held me when I was baptized. He came to every birthday party, every graduation. He sat across from me at countless family dinners while my mother poisoned everything good in our lives." Her voice hardened. "And he was the one who drove the letter opener into her chest."

"Why didn't you tell me this before?"

"Because I didn't remember. I didn't want to remember." Margot's laugh was bitter, hollow. "Do you have any idea what it's like to watch someone you've known your entire life commit murder? My mind just—shut down. Blocked it out. Replaced it with a story that made more sense: Eleanor killed herself, a final act of control. That's what everyone wanted to believe anyway."

I thought about Sterling's confession—how willingly he'd admitted to decades of complicity in Eleanor's crimes. How cooperative he'd been, offering information about the network, about Eleanor's operations. It had seemed like the unburdening of a guilty conscience.

But what if it had been something else entirely? What if Sterling had been confessing to the smaller crimes to distract from the larger one?

"He's been playing me." The words tasted like ash. "This whole time, he's been feeding me information, acting like a reluctant witness finally telling the truth. And all along—"

"All along, he was the one who finished it." Margot leaned forward. "But here's what I don't understand, Detective. Why? My mother trusted Sterling completely. He was one of the only people in the world she actually trusted. What could possibly make him turn on her like that?"

The question hung in the air between us. I thought about everything Sterling had told me—about the phone call from Robert Marlowe that had terrified Eleanor, about the changes to the will, about the network's operations.

And then I remembered something else. Something Sterling had said during our last conversation.

*Eleanor asked me to prepare a new will. One that would cut out everyone—Victor, Julian, even the charities. She wanted to burn the family to the ground.*

"The will." I stood up, the pieces suddenly clicking into place. "Sterling said Eleanor was going to change her will again—to disinherit everyone. But he also said she died before signing it."

"That's right. The old will is still in effect. Victor gets sixty percent, Julian gets his trust—"

"And Sterling?" I interrupted. "What does Sterling get?"

Margot's face went pale. "I—I don't know. I never thought to ask. Mother's will has been revised so many times over the years, I stopped keeping track."

"I need to see the current will. The one that's actually in effect."

"It's at Sterling's office. He has all the originals."

I grabbed my jacket from the back of the chair. "Come with me. You're going to give a formal statement about what you saw."

"Detective—" Margot hesitated. "There's something else. Something Sterling said to my mother before he—before it happened."

"What?"

"He said: 'I've given you thirty-seven years, Eleanor. Thirty-seven years of my life, my conscience, my soul. And this is how you repay me? This is my reward?'" Margot's voice shook. "And my mother—dying, poisoned, just strangled by her own grandson—she laughed at him. She actually laughed and said, 'You were never anything but a tool, David. Tools don't get rewarded. They get replaced.'"

---

The drive to Sterling's office took fifteen minutes. Margot sat in the passenger seat, her hands folded tightly in her lap, staring out at the dark streets of Millbrook. The town looked peaceful at this hour—quiet houses, sleeping families, ordinary lives untouched by the rot that had been growing at its center for decades.

I called Captain Reyes on the way, keeping my voice level as I explained what Margot had revealed.

"Sterling? Are you sure about this, Marlowe?"

"Margot witnessed it. She's ready to give a formal statement."

"Jesus Christ." Reyes was quiet for a moment. "Sterling's been cooperating with the FBI. He's supposed to testify against the network at tomorrow's operation."

"Then the FBI needs to know their star witness is also their primary murder suspect."

"I'll call Torres. She'll want to handle this herself." Reyes paused. "Marlowe—be careful. If Sterling killed Eleanor, he's got nothing left to lose. A man like that is dangerous."

"I know."

Sterling's office was in a converted Victorian house on Oak Street, two blocks from the courthouse. The building was dark when we pulled up, the windows reflecting the amber glow of street lamps. Sterling's car—a silver Mercedes—sat in the small parking lot behind the building.

"He's here." I checked my weapon. "Stay in the car."

"Detective—"

"Stay in the car, Margot. If anything happens, you drive away and call 911."

I didn't wait for her response. I crossed the parking lot quickly, staying low, watching the windows for any sign of movement. The back door of the office was unlocked—never a good sign.

Inside, the building smelled like old paper and leather. Sterling's office was on the second floor, accessible by a narrow staircase that creaked under my weight. I climbed slowly, weapon drawn, ears straining for any sound.

The door to Sterling's office was ajar. Light spilled out into the hallway, accompanied by the soft clink of ice against glass.

"Come in, Detective Marlowe." Sterling's voice was calm, almost friendly. "I've been expecting you."

I pushed the door open. Sterling sat behind his massive oak desk, a crystal tumbler of whiskey in his hand. He looked composed, relaxed—a man who had made peace with something.

"Margot remembered," he said. It wasn't a question.

"You killed Eleanor Ashworth."

"I finished what the others started." Sterling took a sip of his whiskey. "Diana poisoned her. Julian strangled her. All I did was end her suffering." He smiled thinly. "Call it a mercy killing."

"That's not how the law sees it."

"The law." Sterling laughed, the sound hollow and bitter. "I spent thirty-seven years helping Eleanor Ashworth circumvent the law. I drafted documents that made murders look like accidents. I filed papers that buried evidence. I sat in this very office and watched her destroy lives, families, entire communities—and I did nothing. Less than nothing. I helped." He set the glass down on his desk. "So please, Detective, don't lecture me about the law."

"Why?" I kept my weapon trained on him. "Why did you do it? After all those years, after everything you helped her do—why kill her that night?"

Sterling was quiet for a long moment. The clock on his wall—an antique grandfather clock that had probably cost more than my car—ticked away the seconds.

"Because she was going to destroy me too." He reached slowly into his desk drawer—I tensed, but he withdrew only a folded document. "Do you know what this is?"

"The will."

"Not just any will. This is the will Eleanor intended to sign the night she died. The one that would have cut out her entire family." Sterling unfolded it and held it up. "Would you like to know what it says about me?"

"Tell me."

"For thirty-seven years, I had an arrangement with Eleanor. In exchange for my services, I would receive a bequest upon her death. Not the largest share, but substantial—three million dollars and the deed to a property in Maine where I'd hoped to retire." Sterling's jaw tightened. "This new will—the one she was going to sign—eliminated that arrangement entirely. Zero dollars. Zero property. And a clause explicitly stating that I was being removed for 'services no longer meeting expectations.'"

"So you killed her for money."

"I killed her because she used me up and threw me away like garbage." Sterling's voice rose, the first crack in his composure. "Thirty-seven years. I gave her thirty-seven years of my life, my career, my morality. I could have been anything—a judge, a partner at a major firm, a respected member of this community. Instead, I became Eleanor Ashworth's errand boy. Her fixer. Her accomplice." He picked up his glass again, hand trembling. "And when I was no longer useful, she discarded me. No gratitude. No loyalty. Just cold calculation, the way she treated everyone."

"So you waited until she was dying—poisoned and strangled—and you finished the job."

"I made a decision. If Eleanor died before signing the new will, the old one would remain in effect. I would get my bequest. I would have something to show for those thirty-seven wasted years." Sterling drained his glass. "Call it survival instinct. Call it revenge. Call it whatever you want. But don't pretend you wouldn't have done the same."

"I'm not like you."

"No?" Sterling smiled, and there was something knowing in it, something that made my skin crawl. "You're investigating the murder of a woman who destroyed your grandmother, killed your great-grandfather, and controlled this town for sixty years. And you've been doing it by the book, playing by the rules, pretending that justice actually exists." He shook his head. "Deep down, Detective, you're glad she's dead. We all are. The only difference is that I had the courage to do something about it."

I heard sirens in the distance—Reyes must have dispatched backup. Sterling heard them too, and something shifted in his expression.

"The FBI operation tomorrow night," I said. "You were supposed to testify. To help bring down the network."

"I still can. I have evidence, Detective. Thirty-seven years of evidence—documents, recordings, photographs. Enough to put a dozen people in prison for the rest of their lives." Sterling leaned forward. "Including the adjuster."

The name sent a chill through me. "You know who the adjuster is?"

"I know everything. I was Eleanor's right hand for almost four decades. I attended meetings, facilitated payments, drafted contracts." Sterling's eyes were bright now, feverish. "Let me testify tomorrow. Let me help you bring them all down. And in exchange—"

"In exchange, what? You walk free?"

"I accept responsibility for what I did to Eleanor. I'll plead guilty to whatever charge you want. But let me finish what I started. Let me help you destroy the network that Eleanor built." Sterling spread his hands. "It's the only good thing I've done in thirty-seven years. Don't take it away from me now."

The sirens were closer now, red and blue lights painting the windows.

"That's not my decision to make," I said. "That's for the FBI and the district attorney."

Sterling nodded slowly. "Then I suppose we'll find out together what kind of justice this system actually delivers."

---

They took Sterling into custody just before 3 AM. Agent Torres—Margaret—arrived with a team of FBI agents, her face unreadable as she watched him being led out in handcuffs. When she caught my eye, she nodded once—a silent acknowledgment that the case had just gotten more complicated.

Margot gave her formal statement at the station, her voice steady as she recounted what she'd witnessed. Diana's poisoning. Julian's strangulation. And Sterling's final, fatal thrust of the letter opener.

Three hands had touched Eleanor Ashworth's death. Four, if you counted Eleanor herself—because the medical examiner had been right about one thing. The angle of the wound was consistent with self-infliction. Sterling had positioned the letter opener, but Eleanor, in her final moment of consciousness, had grabbed his hand and helped drive it home.

Even dying, she had wanted to control the ending.

"She chose it," Margot said quietly, after the formal interview was over. "Even with Diana's poison in her veins and Julian's fingerprints on her throat and Sterling's hand on the weapon—she still found a way to make it her decision."

"Some people can't let go of control. Even at the end."

"No." Margot looked at me with those haunted eyes. "Some people are so afraid of anyone else having power over them that they'd rather die by their own hand than let someone else take credit."

I thought about my grandmother, who had lived her whole life under Eleanor's shadow. About Marcus Webb, murdered because he dared to love the wrong woman. About Catherine Webb, spending decades gathering evidence while cancer ate her from the inside. About Margaret—Agent Torres—sacrificing thirty years of her life to infiltrate and destroy the network from within.

So many lives, twisted and broken by one woman's need for control.

And now, finally, it was ending.

---

Dawn was breaking when I finally left the station. The sky over Millbrook was turning pink and gold, the first light of a new day touching the sleeping town. In a few hours, everything would be different. The arrests of Morrison and Caldwell had already made the morning news. By tonight, if the warehouse operation succeeded, the entire network would be exposed.

But as I walked to my car, my phone buzzed with a new message. Unknown number.

*The meeting tonight is a trap. Sterling talked before you arrested him. They know you're coming.*

I stared at the screen, my blood running cold. If the network knew about the operation—if they were expecting us—

Another message appeared.

*The adjuster is already in Millbrook. He's been here since yesterday. And he's not coming to the warehouse.*

My hands were shaking as I typed: *Where is he?*

The response came immediately.

*Where do you think? He's tying up loose ends. The witnesses. The evidence. Everyone who can testify.*

I thought about Catherine Webb, frail and dying. About Rosa Martinez in her hospital bed. About my father at the cemetery.

*Who's the target?*

The phone rang. I answered without thinking.

"Detective Marlowe." The voice was distorted, mechanical—the same voice from the chapel attack. But this time, there was something different in it. Something urgent. "Listen very carefully. The adjuster's first target is your father. He's at the old Webb property on the outskirts of town—the house where Marcus grew up. He went there this morning to retrieve something Catherine told him about."

"How do you know this?"

"Because I've been tracking the adjuster for fifteen years. He's the one loose end I could never tie up. The one piece of Eleanor's network I could never identify." The voice paused. "But I know his methods. And I know he's going to eliminate everyone connected to the Webb family before disappearing forever."

"Who are you?"

"You already know." The mechanical distortion faded, and I heard Margaret's voice—Agent Torres, my aunt. "I've been protecting this family my whole life, James. But I can't be everywhere. I need you to get to your father before the adjuster does. Can you do that?"

"Yes."

"Then go. Now." The line went dead.

I was running before I even made the conscious decision. Throwing myself into the car, gunning the engine, tearing through the quiet streets of Millbrook toward the edge of town.

---

The Webb property sat at the end of a dirt road three miles outside Millbrook, hidden behind a stand of oak trees that had been growing since before the Civil War. The house itself was a modest farmhouse—two stories of weathered clapboard, a sagging porch, windows that hadn't seen a cleaning in decades. This was where Marcus Webb had grown up, where he'd dreamed of a life beyond Millbrook's borders before Eleanor Ashworth had cut those dreams short.

My father's truck was parked in the overgrown driveway. No other vehicles in sight—but that meant nothing. The adjuster wouldn't announce his presence.

I killed the engine fifty yards from the house and approached on foot, weapon drawn. The morning sun was fully up now, casting long shadows across the untended lawn. Somewhere in the trees, a crow called out—a harsh, warning sound that seemed to echo the dread coiling in my chest.

The front door was ajar.

I moved up the porch steps, testing each board for creaks. Through the gap in the door, I could see the dim interior—a hallway cluttered with old furniture, dust motes dancing in shafts of light from dirty windows.

"Dad?" I called out, pushing the door open with my foot. "Robert?"

No answer. But I heard something—a faint thump from somewhere above. The second floor.

I climbed the stairs with my back against the wall, weapon up, every sense straining. The house smelled of decay and neglect, of memories left to rot. At the top of the stairs, a narrow hallway stretched toward the back of the house, doors opening onto empty rooms.

Another sound. A muffled voice. Coming from the last room on the right.

I moved down the hallway, each step deliberate, controlled. The door was closed. I pressed my ear against the wood and heard my father's voice—strained, angry:

"—don't know what you're talking about. There's nothing here."

And then another voice. Calm. Measured. Cold.

"Mr. Marlowe, please. We both know that's not true. Catherine Webb spent forty years gathering evidence against the network. She told you where she hid the originals before she died. I need that evidence."

"Go to hell."

I heard a sound like a slap, followed by my father's grunt of pain.

"I don't enjoy this," the cold voice continued. "Believe it or not, I take no pleasure in violence. It's simply a tool—a means to an end. Like everything else in life. Now, you can tell me where the evidence is, or I can hurt you until you do. The outcome will be the same. The only variable is how much you suffer first."

I didn't wait any longer. I kicked the door open and swept into the room, weapon trained on the figure standing over my father.

The adjuster.

He was smaller than I'd expected. Average height, average build, forgettable features—the kind of man you'd pass on the street without a second glance. He wore a dark suit, impeccably tailored, and his hair was graying at the temples. His eyes were pale blue, almost colorless, and completely empty.

My father sat in a wooden chair in the center of the room, his hands bound behind him with zip ties. Blood trickled from a cut on his lip, but his eyes—when they found mine—were clear. Alert.

"Detective Marlowe." The adjuster didn't seem surprised. If anything, he seemed faintly amused. "I wondered when you'd arrive. Your aunt's warning, I presume?"

"Put your hands up. Slowly."

"Of course." The adjuster raised his hands, palms out. No weapon visible—but I knew that meant nothing. A man like this was never truly unarmed. "I have to say, I'm impressed. Most people in your position would have called for backup. Waited for reinforcements. But you came alone. Admirable, if somewhat foolish."

"Shut up." I moved into the room, keeping the adjuster in my sights. "Dad, are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Robert's voice was steady despite the circumstances. "He was just asking about Catherine's evidence. I didn't tell him anything."

"Very loyal." The adjuster lowered his hands slightly. "Family loyalty—it's become quite rare these days. Eleanor understood that. She cultivated it, manipulated it, weaponized it. It's how she kept control for so long."

"I said put your hands up."

"Detective, let's be practical." The adjuster took a small step toward me. "You're not going to shoot an unarmed man. It's not in your nature. I've read your file—exemplary service record, commendations for bravery, strict adherence to procedure. You're what they call a 'good cop.'" His lips curved into something that might have been a smile on someone capable of human emotion. "Good cops don't execute people."

"Stay where you are."

"The evidence your father is protecting—it's not what you think. Catherine Webb spent decades documenting Eleanor's network, yes. But she also documented something else. Something far more valuable." The adjuster's pale eyes fixed on mine. "She documented the cleanup. Every adjustment I ever made. Every problem I ever solved. Names, dates, methods—everything."

"Why would she do that?"

"Insurance. Catherine knew that if Eleanor ever discovered her surveillance, she would send me to deal with it. So she created a failsafe—documentation of my work that would be released if anything happened to her." The adjuster shook his head. "Clever woman. She understood the game better than most."

"Where's the evidence, Dad?"

Robert didn't answer immediately. His eyes moved between me and the adjuster, calculating.

"James—"

"Tell me where it is. We can end this right now."

"It's in the basement," Robert said finally. "Hidden in the old root cellar. Catherine showed me years ago, made me promise to retrieve it if anything ever happened to her."

The adjuster smiled. "Thank you, Mr. Marlowe. That's all I needed."

He moved faster than I thought possible. One moment he was standing with his hands raised; the next, he had produced a small pistol from somewhere—his sleeve, his waistband, I couldn't tell—and fired.

The bullet caught me in the left shoulder, spinning me sideways. My own shot went wide, punching through the wall. Pain exploded through my body, hot and sharp, and I stumbled backward, trying to keep my weapon up.

"James!" My father's shout seemed to come from very far away.

The adjuster was already moving toward the door, his pistol trained on me. "I really am sorry about this, Detective. You seem like a decent man. In another life, we might have been on the same side."

I fired again, but my arm wouldn't cooperate. The shot went low, splintering the doorframe as the adjuster ducked into the hallway.

"Dad—" I pressed my hand against my shoulder, feeling hot blood pulse between my fingers. "The flare gun. Catherine's emergency kit—is it still here?"

Robert's eyes widened with understanding. "Under the bed. She always kept one in every safe house."

I dropped to my knees, the world swimming around me, and reached under the old iron bedframe. My fingers closed around a metal case—Catherine's emergency kit, dusty but intact. Inside: a flare gun, loaded, and two extra flares.

Heavy footsteps on the stairs. The adjuster, heading for the basement.

I grabbed the flare gun and forced myself to my feet. The pain in my shoulder was a living thing now, a fire that threatened to consume everything. But I'd been shot before—a graze, during a drug bust three years ago. This was worse, much worse, but I could still move. I could still fight.

"Stay here," I told my father. "I'll be back."

"James, you're bleeding—"

"Stay here."

I staggered into the hallway, leaving a trail of blood on the worn wooden floor. At the top of the stairs, I could hear the adjuster below, moving through the house toward the basement entrance.

I descended as quietly as I could, each step a small eternity of pain. My left arm hung useless at my side, the flare gun clutched in my right hand. At the bottom of the stairs, I saw the adjuster's silhouette disappear through a door at the back of the hallway—the basement entrance.

I followed.

The basement stairs were steeper than the main staircase, descending into darkness. I could hear the adjuster below, his footsteps echoing off stone walls. A flashlight beam cut through the blackness—he was searching for the root cellar.

I raised the flare gun.

"Stop."

The adjuster turned, his flashlight blinding me for a moment. In his other hand, the pistol.

"Detective Marlowe. Persistent." He sounded almost impressed. "But you're in no condition to—"

I fired.

The flare erupted from the gun with a sound like a thunderclap, trailing brilliant orange fire as it crossed the basement. It struck the adjuster square in the chest, igniting his jacket, his shirt, his skin. For one terrible moment, he was a pillar of flame in the darkness, a human torch screaming in a voice that seemed too high, too raw, too human for the monster he was.

He stumbled backward, arms pinwheeling. His foot found the edge of the top step.

And then he fell.

I watched him tumble down the remaining basement stairs, still burning, still screaming. The sound was horrible—wet and animal and endless. He hit the bottom with a heavy thud, flames licking at the old wooden beams, illuminating the basement in hellish orange light.

I half-ran, half-fell down the stairs after him, my weapon raised despite the agony in my shoulder. The smoke was thick now, acrid, and I could barely see.

But when I reached the bottom, my flashlight beam cutting through the haze—

There was no one there.

I swept the light across the basement floor. Scorch marks on the stone. Burnt fabric scattered like confetti. A single shoe, still smoldering. But no body. No adjuster.

He had vanished.

I searched for what felt like hours but could only have been minutes. I checked every corner, every shadow, every possible hiding place. I found the root cellar and the evidence Catherine had hidden—boxes of documents, photographs, recordings. But of the adjuster, there was no sign. Not a blood trail, not a footprint, not a single indication of which direction he had gone.

It was as if he had simply ceased to exist. As if the flames had consumed him entirely and the earth had swallowed what remained.

But I knew better. Men like the adjuster didn't simply disappear. They retreated, regrouped, waited. And somewhere out there, in whatever shadow he had crawled into to lick his wounds, he would be planning his next move.

The fire was spreading now, climbing the basement walls toward the main floor. I grabbed what evidence I could carry and stumbled back up the stairs, my vision darkening at the edges, my legs threatening to give out with every step.

My father met me in the hallway, somehow free of his bonds—he'd always been good with knots, a skill he'd learned in the Navy.

"James—God, you're white as a sheet. We need to get you to a hospital."

"The evidence," I managed. "Catherine's evidence. It's in my arms."

"I've got it. I've got you. Come on."

We made it out of the house just as the fire reached the first floor. Standing in the overgrown lawn, watching the old Webb farmhouse burn, I felt something fundamental shift inside me. The adjuster was gone—vanished like smoke, like a ghost, like the phantom he had always been. But I had faced him. I had survived.

And I had the evidence that would bring down everything Eleanor Ashworth had built.

---

The doctors at Millbrook General said I was lucky. The bullet had passed through cleanly, missing the major arteries and the bone. A few inches to the right and it would have shattered my clavicle. A few inches lower and it would have punctured my lung. "Someone up there likes you," the surgeon said with a tired smile.

But luck felt like the wrong word. Lucky was finding a twenty-dollar bill on the sidewalk. Lucky was catching all green lights on your way to work. This wasn't luck—this was survival, raw and brutal and earned in blood.

The wound healed—slowly, imperfectly, leaving a puckered scar that pulled whenever I raised my arm too high. The physical therapist said I'd regain most of my range of motion with time, but I'd never be quite the same. She was right, though not in the way she meant. On cold mornings, the shoulder ached with a deep, persistent throb that woke me before dawn. On rainy days, it stiffened until I could barely lift a coffee cup, each movement a small reminder of that basement, those flames, those empty pale eyes.

The nerve damage was the worst of it. Some days, my left hand would go numb without warning—in the middle of writing a report, or holding my weapon at the range, or reaching across the table for a glass of water. The doctors called it peripheral neuropathy, a clinical term for the way the bullet had carved its path through muscle and tissue, leaving dead zones in its wake. I called it a ghost that lived in my shoulder, haunting me with phantom sensations and sudden absences of feeling.

It became part of me, that wound. A reminder written in scar tissue and nerve damage. Every time I reached for something and felt that familiar pull, I remembered the basement. The flames. The adjuster's pale eyes, colorless and empty as a winter sky. I remembered the sound of the gun, the impact that had spun me sideways, the hot rush of blood between my fingers. I remembered how close I had come to dying—how close my father had come to dying—in that abandoned farmhouse on the edge of town.

The scar was more than a physical memento. It was a marker, a division between the man I had been before and the man I was becoming. Before the Webb house, I had believed in clean endings. Good guys win, bad guys lose, justice prevails. After—I understood that some stories don't end. Some monsters don't die. They just retreat into the shadows and wait.

I'd catch myself sometimes, absent-mindedly running my fingers over the ridged scar tissue through my shirt, tracing the shape of my mortality. It was there when I woke in the night, heart pounding from dreams of fire and falling. It was there when I dressed each morning, the mirror showing me the puckered flesh where the bullet had entered and the larger, uglier exit wound on my back. It was there in every small hesitation, every moment of caution that I hadn't possessed before.

The adjuster had vanished without a trace. Not escaped—vanished. When I reached the bottom of those basement stairs, flashlight cutting through smoke and ash, there was nothing. Scorch marks on the stone floor. Fragments of burnt fabric scattered like dark confetti. A single shoe, still smoldering, the leather curled and blackened. But no body. No blood trail. No indication of which direction he had gone or how he had survived the flames that had engulfed him.

I searched until the fire drove me out. I searched the ruins after the fire department contained the blaze. I returned the next day, and the day after that, sifting through ash and debris until my hands were black and my lungs ached from the dust. Nothing. No bones. No DNA evidence despite the clear burns he had sustained. No trace that he had ever existed at all.

Agent Torres told me that the bureau had been tracking him for years without ever getting close. "He's a ghost," she said. "Always has been. Some people think he's not even one person—that 'the adjuster' is a title, passed down through generations of fixers. A name that doesn't die because it was never attached to a single man."

I didn't know what to believe. All I knew was that somewhere out there, a man with pale blue eyes was either dead or nursing his wounds, either gone forever or planning his return. The uncertainty gnawed at me. Closure was a luxury I couldn't afford—not when there was no body, no proof, no ending to the story.

In the meantime, I had work to do. Catherine Webb's evidence proved to be everything Sterling had promised and more. Names, dates, transactions—a complete map of Eleanor Ashworth's network stretching back decades. The warehouse operation was canceled, but it didn't matter. With the evidence in hand, the FBI was able to execute arrests across three states. The network that had controlled Millbrook for sixty years was finally, irrevocably broken.

But the victory felt hollow. Or perhaps I was just too tired to feel much of anything except the constant ache in my shoulder, the permanent reminder of what victory had cost.

Every time I sat at my desk reviewing case files, I felt the scar tissue shift beneath my shirt, pulling with each breath. Every time I drew my weapon at the range, my shoulder screamed in protest, the recoil sending electric jolts of pain down my arm. Every night, in the moments before sleep, I saw flames and empty eyes and the place where a body should have been.

I learned to shoot with my right hand leading, compensating for the weakness on my left. I learned to sleep with a heating pad, to take ibuprofen before rainstorms, to hide the grimace when someone clapped me on my bad shoulder. I learned to live with the ghost in my flesh, the adjuster's final gift—a wound that would never fully heal, a reminder that would last the rest of my life.

On the worst nights, when the pain kept me awake and the shadows seemed to press close, I would sit by my window and watch the empty street below. Somewhere out there—maybe—a man without a face was doing the same. Waiting. Watching. Planning.

And so was I. The scar on my shoulder pulsed with each heartbeat, a second clock ticking away the hours until our paths crossed again. If they ever did. If he had survived at all.

Some questions don't have answers. Some monsters don't stay dead. And some wounds never stop hurting, no matter how much time passes.

I carried mine like a badge, like a warning, like a prayer. It was the price of survival. It was the proof that I had faced the darkness and lived to tell the tale.

And if the adjuster ever came back, he would find me ready. Changed. Harder.

Waiting.
