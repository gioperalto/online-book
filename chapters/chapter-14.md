# Shadows in the Windows

#### "You don't close a wound by pretending it never happened. You close it by letting it heal." - Rosa Martinez

The text message burned in my mind as I drove through the quiet streets of Millbrook. The drive from the station took twenty minutes, longer than usual because I found myself taking turns I didn't need to take, circling blocks twice, checking my rearview mirror for tails. *Look closer at your own house, Detective.*

My own house. The words could mean a dozen things—my home, my family, my department. Someone still inside the network, watching me, waiting. Someone who knew that Morrison and Caldwell were only the beginning.

I pulled into my driveway and sat in the darkness for a long moment. The bungalow I'd lived in for eighteen years looked the same as always—porch light glowing amber, paint peeling slightly around the windows, the old maple tree casting shadows across the front lawn. A house where I'd slept alone for three years, where I'd eaten breakfast alone, where the silence had become so familiar I'd stopped noticing it.

What was I missing?

Inside, everything was as I'd left it. Coffee mug in the sink. Case files spread across the kitchen table. The photograph I kept face-down, no longer hidden now that I knew its secrets. I picked it up and studied the image again—my grandmother, my father as a teenager, the Ashworth estate in the background. Eleanor watching from the portico with that predatory stare.

My phone buzzed again. Same unknown number.

*Not the building. The bloodline. The inheritance you didn't know you had.*

I stared at the words, a chill spreading through my chest. What inheritance? Catherine Webb had told me about my grandmother's relationship with Marcus Webb, about my father's true parentage. I was Marcus's great-grandson by blood. But what else was there?

Before I could respond, a knock at my front door made me reach for my weapon.

"James." The voice was familiar. "It's Catherine."

I holstered my gun and opened the door. Catherine Webb stood on my porch, smaller than she'd seemed at the cemetery, wrapped in a gray wool coat that seemed to swallow her diminishing frame. Behind her, a taxi idled at the curb.

"May I come in? There's something I should have told you earlier."

I stepped aside to let her pass. She moved slowly, carefully, like someone who knew her body was failing and had made peace with it. The taxi pulled away as I closed the door.

"You shouldn't be out alone," I said. "Morrison and Caldwell may be in custody, but the network—"

"The network already knows where I am." Catherine settled into the armchair by the window with a sigh. "They've always known. Eleanor never bothered to have me killed because she thought I was harmless—an old woman with a grudge and no credibility. By the time I became a real threat, I was already dying." She smiled faintly. "Cancer has its advantages. Hard to fear someone who's racing you to the grave."

"You received the same text messages." It wasn't a question.

"Not the same. But similar." Catherine pulled out her phone, hands trembling slightly as she scrolled. She held it up for me to read:

*You're running out of time, Catherine. The truth about Marcus will die with you. Unless you tell James everything.*

"I don't understand," I said. "What haven't you told me?"

Catherine was quiet for a long moment. The clock on my wall ticked, marking seconds that seemed to stretch into hours. Outside, a car drove past, its headlights briefly illuminating the curtains before fading away. I waited, knowing some revelations couldn't be rushed.

"When I first met your grandmother—really met her, years after everything that happened with Marcus—she gave me something. A document she'd hidden for decades. Something she made me promise to keep safe until the right person came along." Catherine reached into her coat and produced a yellowed envelope. "She said I would know when the time was right. I think this is it."

I took the envelope carefully. The paper was old, brittle at the edges, bearing my grandmother's handwriting: *For the one who will finish what we started.*

Inside was a single sheet, folded into thirds. I opened it, and my breath caught in my throat.

*Certificate of Live Birth*
*State of Washington*
*Date: June 15, 19XX*
*Child: Margaret Helen Webb*
*Mother: Helen Marie Foster*
*Father: Marcus Andrew Webb*

"I don't understand." My voice sounded distant, disconnected from my body. "My father was born in Michigan. In 1958."

"Robert is your grandmother's son by her legal husband—your grandfather in name." Catherine's voice was gentle. "But your grandmother was pregnant twice. The second time was your father. The first time was your aunt Margaret."

"Did Eleanor know—"

"Eleanor knew." Catherine's eyes were bright with tears. "She had eyes everywhere. When your grandmother went into labor, she drove herself to a clinic in Seattle. She gave birth to a daughter and named her Margaret, after Marcus's mother."

A daughter. My grandmother had a daughter. A daughter who would be—

"She would be a few years older than your father," Catherine said, reading my thoughts. "If she were still alive."

"What happened to her?"

"Eleanor happened." Catherine paused.

The room tilted. My father had a sister? I had an aunt? I sat down heavily, the birth certificate still clutched in my hands. A sinking feeling in my gut. I asked, as much as I dreaded what I would hear next. "Please. What happened to my aunt?"

Catherine's eyes glossed over. She paused, took a deep breath, and a small weep escaped her mouth. In almost a whisper, she spoke.

"You hadn't been born yet. Your aunt was still a toddler. So vibrant and happy. But Eleanor knew whose daughter she was. The child of Helen and Marcus. It drove a screw into her heart and twisted it. Perhaps seeing that child so happy is what turned Eleanor into the monster she came to be. Could have been any other number of things."

I waited for my great-aunt to continue. My impatience tempered by the struggle I saw in her eyes. Sharing this secret was crushing her soul. I kept blinking, washing away tears that were eager to escape.

"Eleanor was a sick woman. Maybe she was just born that way. But the child. My poor, innocent niece. She loved to play outside. I was watching her that day. I had no idea who Eleanor was—or what evil she was capable of. You see I had come visit your grandparents on my brother's request. Watching a toddler play in the grass was easy enough. But there was a lake nearby."

"She drowned?" I questioned, eliciting a look of seething anger from Catherine.

"Didn't your father teach you manners?" she remarked. "In my day we let people finish speaking."

I resisted the urge to drop a snarky response, remembering first that this was my flesh and blood lashing out in a moment of vulnerability.

"Sorry." I added.

"To cut the story short, yes." The overtone of grief and emotion was sucked out of the room. My great-aunt's mask was back up, and the moment was lost. "I know it was Eleanor's doing but I could never prove it. In the brief moment my niece was left unatended—and I was distracted—she drowned in the lake. We found her later that day. The memory still haunts me. I left town shortly after and never returned. My heart was shattered, and some part of me always thought my brother never forgave me for it."

"I may not have known my grandfather," I responded, in a weak attempt to redeem myself for my recent actions. "but he doesn't blame you."

"What makes you say that?" The Webb matriarch petitioned with pleading eyes.

"Because before me I see a woman not afraid to be open and vulnerable," I kept going. "unlike Eleanor who was cold, rigid, indifferent, petty, vengeful, nothing short of—"

"I get it!" My great-aunt smiled after reprimanding me.

A moment of silence. Perhaps for my aunt I never got to know. Catherine's grief was age-old but mine was fresh. Pandora's box had been opened and I was now missing something—someone—I never knew existed. We continued to sit in silence, a shared family experience that boiled into cumulative anger for a soul we could no longer exact vengeance on. This must have been how my grandmother felt all these years.

I thought about my visit to Rosa in the hospital. The fear in her eyes when I'd mentioned Eleanor's other victims. The way she'd clutched my hand and whispered, *Be careful, Detective. The truth is bigger than you know.*

Millbrook General was quiet at this hour. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead as I walked the corridors, badge out, nodding to the night nurses who recognized me from my earlier visits.

Rosa's room was at the end of the critical care wing. Through the window in the door, I could see her lying motionless, monitors beeping their steady rhythm. But as I reached for the handle, a voice stopped me.

"Detective Marlowe."

I turned. Agent Rebecca Torres stood in the hallway, her gray suit rumpled, a paper cup of coffee in her hand. She looked as exhausted as I felt.

"Agent Torres. I didn't expect to see you here."

"I've been interviewing Mrs. Martinez. Trying to get whatever information she's willing to share about Eleanor's network." Torres took a sip of her coffee stared at me with the sharp-eyed focus of someone who'd learned to read people for a living. "She keeps asking for you. Says there's something she needs to tell you—something she'll only tell you."

"Then let me see her."

"First, I need to know what you're really after." Torres stepped closer. "The evidence from that safety deposit box is explosive—enough to bring corruption charges against half the power structure in this town. But you're not satisfied with that, are you? You're digging for something deeper."

"I'm investigating a murder. The investigation goes where the evidence leads."

"Don't play games with me, Detective." Torres's voice was hard. "I've spent eighteen months building this case. I'm not going to let some personal vendetta blow it apart."

"It's not a vendetta. It's—" I stopped, searching for words that would make sense to someone who hadn't lived this case from the inside.

"It's what?" The agent studied my facial expression.

Torres was quiet for a long moment, processing. Then she stepped aside. "Go. Talk to Mrs. Martinez. But I want to know what she tells you."

"If it's relevant to your case, you'll know."

"And if it's not?"

I didn't answer. I just pushed open the door and stepped into Rosa's room.

---

Rosa was awake, her eyes tracking me as I approached the bed. She looked smaller than I remembered, diminished by the hospital gown and the tubes running into her arms. But her gaze was sharp, alert—the same gaze that had watched over the Ashworth family for thirty-five years.

"Detective." Her voice was a whisper. "You found out about Margaret."

I nodded and sat in the chair beside her bed.

"I'm sorry." Rosa tried to get up, the motion costing her visible effort. "I know I wasn't the one who did it. But she was just a child."

"I know."

Rosa nodded, tears streaming down her face.

We walked to the hospital roof in silence. Torres led the way through service corridors and emergency stairs, her movements practiced, confident. She'd been here before. She knew the building the way she knew the network: from the inside, every angle calculated.

The night air was cold and clean. The lights of Millbrook spread out below us, a constellation of quiet streets and sleeping houses. Somewhere out there, the remaining members of Eleanor's network were plotting their next moves. 

"So did you find anything new?" Torres said, staring out at the lights.

"Nothing relevant to the investigation."

"Can I ask what you two spoke about?" She turned to face me, appearing concerned.

"Family matters." I looked back at her.

"I get it." I saw a wince of pain in her eyes. 

"What did Eleanor do to you?" I asked, fishing for something my gut was guiding me to.

"I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours." She smiled, provocative.

"Any new developments with the case?" It was time we changed the subject.

"We were down to three unknown names on Eleanor's list," she said suddenly. "One of them is dead. Killed himself when he found out the FBI was investigating—probably thought it was better than what the network would do to him if he talked. Another is in witness protection, cooperating with my investigation."

"And the third?"

"The third is the problem." Margaret's jaw tightened. "The third is someone who's been cleaning up the network's messes for forty years. Someone who was Eleanor's most trusted operative—her 'adjuster,' the one she called when something needed to disappear quietly."

"Who?"

"I don't know his real name. No one does. He's a ghost. Just a legend and a body count." Margaret looked at me. "But I know where he's going to be tomorrow night."

I thought about my father, waiting at the cemetery. About my grandmother, who'd spent her whole life in terror. About Marcus Webb, murdered and erased. About all the victims whose names I would never know.

We walked back down through the hospital in silence. At the main entrance, Margaret paused.

"James? For what it's worth—I'm sorry. I know what it's like to lose loved ones because of the Ashworths."

"Thank you." The words came out softer than I expected. I didn't dare ask more. It was my turn to respect her confidentiality after she did the same for me up on the roof.

Margaret nodded, something like grief flickering across her face. Then she turned and walked off.

---

I drove home through empty streets, my mind churning. Tomorrow night, everything would change. Either the network would fall, or I would.

As as I pulled into my driveway, I noticed something wrong. My front door was open—just a crack, but enough to let a sliver of light spill onto the porch.

I drew my weapon and approached slowly. The door swung open at my touch.

Inside, sitting at my kitchen table with the face-down photograph in her hands, was Margot Ashworth.

"Detective Marlowe," she said quietly. "We need to talk about what really happened to my mother. Because I don't think she killed herself at all."
