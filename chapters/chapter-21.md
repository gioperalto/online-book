# The Trial Begins

Diana Ashworth stood in the defendant's box like a woman attending a society function she found distasteful but necessary. Her posture was impeccable, her gray Chanel suit perfectly tailored, her blonde hair swept back in a style that probably cost more than most jurors' monthly rent. Only her hands betrayed her—knuckles white where they gripped the wooden rail in front of her.

I watched from the gallery, three rows back on the prosecution's side. Margaret sat beside me, her FBI credentials tucked into her jacket pocket, her face arranged into the same expressionless mask she'd worn through a dozen such proceedings. My father had wanted to come—had insisted, actually—but I'd talked him out of it. Some things are better witnessed alone.

"The State of New York calls Detective James Marlowe."

The courtroom fell silent as I rose. Every eye tracked my movement down the aisle and up to the witness stand—the reporters in the back, the Ashworth family attorneys at their mahogany table, the jury of twelve whose expressions ranged from curious to skeptical to already bored.

And Diana. Diana watched me with those sharp green eyes that had seen so much and given away so little. When I took the oath—*the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth*—something flickered across her face. Recognition, perhaps. Or maybe just the cold satisfaction of knowing that the truth I was about to tell would never capture what really happened in that library.

District Attorney Elizabeth Kwan was a small woman with a voice that could cut glass. She'd been assigned to the case after the previous DA—one of Eleanor's network contacts—had quietly resigned in the wake of the *Detroit Free Press* exposé. Kwan had a reputation for being incorruptible, which was why the governor had personally appointed her.

"Detective Marlowe," she began, "please describe your role in the investigation into the death of Eleanor Ashworth."

I walked the jury through it. The initial call. The crime scene. The three methods of death that had puzzled us from the start. I kept my voice steady, professional—the voice I'd cultivated over twenty-six years of testimony, the one that conveyed competence without emotion.

"Based on your investigation, what did you determine about the cause of death?"

"The medical examiner ruled that Eleanor Ashworth died from a combination of factors: aconitum poisoning, strangulation, and a stabbing wound to the chest." I turned slightly to face the jury. "The toxicology report indicated that the poison—derived from monkshood, a common garden flower—was administered approximately two hours before death. The strangulation was initiated but not completed. The stabbing wound, delivered with a letter opener found at the scene, was the immediate cause of death."

"And did your investigation determine who was responsible for each of these actions?"

"Yes." I looked at Diana, and she looked back. Neither of us blinked. "The evidence indicated that the defendant, Diana Ashworth, was responsible for administering the poison. A separate individual attempted the strangulation. And a third party delivered the fatal stabbing wound."

A murmur rippled through the gallery. Judge Katherine Mills—the federal appointee brought in from Albany after Judge Harper's arrest—rapped her gavel once.

"Order."

Kwan continued. "Can you describe the evidence that led you to conclude the defendant was responsible for the poisoning?"

This was the part I'd rehearsed. The part where words became weapons and a woman's life hung in the balance.

"The defendant confessed to administering the poison during our interview at the Ashworth estate. She stated that she had cultivated monkshood in the estate's conservatory and had extracted the toxin herself. She claimed her intention was to incapacitate Eleanor Ashworth, not to kill her."

"Did she explain why she wanted to incapacitate the victim?"

"She stated that she and her husband, Victor Ashworth, planned to search Eleanor's office for documents that could be used against them. Eleanor had recently discovered that Victor was embezzling family funds, and Diana believed there might be evidence that could lead to their disinheritance or criminal charges."

"And did the defendant express remorse for her actions?"

I paused. This was where the truth got complicated.

"She expressed regret that Eleanor died. She maintained that she had calculated the dosage to cause temporary incapacitation, not death, and that the fatal wound was delivered by someone else after the poison had already compromised the victim."

Defense attorney Malcolm Price rose from the mahogany table. "Objection. The witness is characterizing the defendant's statements without the context of duress and—"

"Overruled." Judge Mills's voice was crisp. "The detective is describing his interview. You'll have your chance on cross-examination, Mr. Price."

Price sat down, but his eyes remained on me. I knew that look. He was already planning how to tear my testimony apart.

---

The cross-examination came after lunch.

Malcolm Price was the kind of attorney who wore his credentials like armor—Harvard Law, former federal prosecutor, three acquittals in high-profile murder cases. He approached the witness stand with the confidence of a man who'd never met a witness he couldn't break.

"Detective Marlowe." He positioned himself between me and the jury, blocking their view. A classic intimidation tactic. "You've testified that my client confessed to administering the poison. Is that correct?"

"That's correct."

"And this confession occurred during an informal interview at the Ashworth estate, not at a police station?"

"Yes."

"Was my client read her Miranda rights before this confession?"

Here it was. The first trap.

"The interview was conducted as part of an ongoing investigation. Mrs. Ashworth was not under arrest at the time and was not in custody. Miranda rights were not required."

"But she became a suspect shortly after, didn't she? In fact, you arrested her that same day."

"The evidence gathered during the interview contributed to my decision to arrest her, yes."

Price smiled—a thin, predatory expression. "So you used an informal conversation to extract a confession, then immediately used that confession as grounds for arrest. Wouldn't you say that's a convenient workaround for constitutional protections?"

"Objection." Kwan was on her feet. "Argumentative."

"Sustained."

Price didn't miss a beat. "Let me rephrase. Detective, in your twenty-six years on the force, how many times have you conducted informal interviews that resulted in confessions used to justify immediate arrests?"

"I don't have an exact count."

"More than ten? More than fifty?"

"I couldn't say without reviewing my case files."

"Then let me ask you this." Price stepped closer, close enough that I could smell his expensive cologne. "You have a personal connection to the Ashworth family, don't you?"

The courtroom seemed to hold its breath.

"My grandmother was employed by the Ashworth family over sixty years ago. She passed away in 1994."

"And isn't it true that your grandmother had a romantic relationship with a man named Marcus Webb, who was later killed in circumstances linked to Eleanor Ashworth?"

"Objection." Kwan's voice was sharp. "Relevance. The detective's family history has no bearing on the defendant's guilt or innocence."

Judge Mills considered for a moment. "I'll allow it within limits, Mr. Price. Establish the relevance quickly."

Price turned back to me, satisfaction gleaming in his eyes. "Detective, isn't it true that you believe Eleanor Ashworth was responsible for the death of your grandmother's lover? And the subsequent destruction of your grandmother's life?"

"There is evidence to support that conclusion, yes."

"Evidence you uncovered during this very investigation?"

"Yes."

"So you had a personal motive to see Eleanor Ashworth brought to justice—or, failing that, to see those associated with her punished?"

I felt my hands tighten on the arms of the witness chair. This was the moment I'd dreaded—the moment when my family history became a weapon against the case I'd built.

"I conducted this investigation according to the same standards I've applied to every case in my career. My personal history did not influence my conclusions."

"But it might have influenced your methods, mightn't it?" Price gestured toward the gallery, where Diana sat watching with those unreadable green eyes. "You were so eager to find someone guilty of harming Eleanor Ashworth that you seized on my client's statements without proper procedure. You built a case on a confession given without counsel present, without Miranda warnings, in circumstances that any objective observer would describe as coercive."

"That's not accurate."

"No?" Price's voice rose. "Then explain to the jury why, in the midst of investigating a murder with multiple potential perpetrators, you focused so heavily on my client. Why Diana Ashworth, and not the man who actually delivered the fatal wound? Why the woman who administered a non-lethal dose of poison, and not the lawyer who drove the blade home?"

"David Sterling is facing separate charges—"

"I'm not asking about Sterling's charges. I'm asking why you chose to pursue my client with such... enthusiasm." Price leaned in. "Could it be that Diana Ashworth made an easy target? A woman with no prior criminal record, no resources to fight back against the full weight of the state, married into a family you had every reason to despise?"

"Objection!" Kwan was standing again. "Counsel is badgering the witness."

"Sustained. Mr. Price, rein it in."

Price stepped back, but the damage was done. I could see it in the jurors' faces—the seed of doubt, the question that would linger through deliberations. *Was this detective really objective? Or was this personal?*

BUT the trial took a turn no one expected on the third day.

I was in the courthouse hallway, reviewing my notes for a possible recall to the stand, when Margaret found me. Her face was pale, her usual composure cracked around the edges.

"We have a problem."

She led me to a private conference room where Assistant DA Kwan was already waiting, her expression thunderous. On the table between them lay a manila folder thick with documents.

"Sterling flipped again," Kwan said without preamble. "He's recanting his testimony."

I felt the floor shift beneath me. "What?"

"His new story is that he didn't see Diana administer the poison. That he only assumed it was her based on Eleanor's symptoms and the proximity of the conservatory plants." Kwan slapped her palm on the folder. "He's claiming his original statement was coerced—that the FBI pressured him into naming Diana to strengthen the case against the network."

"That's a lie. His confession was recorded."

"His confession was a man desperate to avoid life in prison for murder." Margaret's voice was tight. "His lawyers are arguing that he said whatever we wanted to hear in exchange for the deal we offered. Now that the deal is finalized and he's already been sentenced to his reduced term, he's free to change his story without consequence."

"He can't just—" I stopped, realization dawning. "Someone got to him."

"Almost certainly." Margaret pulled a photograph from her jacket pocket. "Prison visitor logs from yesterday. Sterling had two visitors—his attorney, which is standard, and this woman."

I studied the photo. A woman in her fifties, professionally dressed, with silver-streaked auburn hair and sharp features I didn't recognize.

"Who is she?"

"That's what we're trying to determine. She signed in under the name Patricia Williams, but the ID she used was fake. The address doesn't exist, the driver's license number is invalid." Margaret took the photo back. "We ran her image through facial recognition. Nothing in federal databases, but the state system got a partial hit."

She laid another document on the table—a twenty-year-old booking photo of a much younger woman with the same sharp features.

"Patricia Webb. Arrested in 1998 for fraud, charges dropped. Last known address: Seattle, Washington."

The name hit me like a punch to the chest. "Webb?"

"Marcus Webb's cousin. She disappeared after the charges were dropped—presumably courtesy of Eleanor's network. If she's back and she's visiting Sterling..." Margaret shook her head. "Someone is trying to sabotage this trial from the inside."

I stared at the photo, trying to make sense of it. Patricia Webb. Another piece of the family puzzle I'd never known existed. Another ghost from Eleanor's past, surfacing at the worst possible moment.

"If Sterling recants, can Kwan still make the case?"

"She can try. We have Diana's own confession, physical evidence from the conservatory, financial records showing she purchased extraction equipment online." Kwan gathered the documents. "But Sterling's testimony was supposed to corroborate the timeline. Without it, the defense will argue that anyone in the house could have administered the poison. Price will have a field day."

"What about Sarah? She witnessed Diana watching Eleanor during dinner. She can testify—"

"Sarah's testimony is already compromised by her personal history and the evidence tampering." Margaret cut me off. "If we put her on the stand now, Price will tear her apart. The jury will see a bitter ex-wife with a grudge, not a credible witness."

I thought about Diana, sitting in that defendant's box with her perfect posture and her Chanel suit. She'd poisoned Eleanor Ashworth—I had no doubt about that. She'd confessed to my face, described her methods, explained her reasoning. And now, because of a ghost from the past and a lawyer willing to twist the truth, she might walk free.

"There has to be something else. Something we missed."

---

THEREFORE I spent the next forty-eight hours tearing apart every piece of evidence we'd collected.

I started with the conservatory itself. The Ashworth estate was still technically a crime scene, maintained by a skeleton crew of officers who were more interested in their phones than in preserving chain of custody. I walked through the glass-walled room where Diana had grown her poison, examining every plant, every pot, every bag of soil.

The monkshood was gone—collected as evidence, bagged and tagged and sitting in a police storage locker. But Diana hadn't just grown the plants. She'd extracted the toxin, concentrated it, dissolved it in something palatable enough to add to Eleanor's tea without detection.

Where had she done the extraction?

I found it in a corner of the conservatory I'd overlooked during the initial investigation—a small potting station with a sink, a hotplate, and a set of glass beakers that didn't match the rest of the gardening equipment. The beakers were too precise, too laboratory-grade. They belonged in a chemistry lab, not a greenhouse.

More importantly, one of the beakers still held residue.

I called Margaret immediately. "I need a forensic team back at the estate. The conservatory potting station—there's lab equipment that wasn't logged in the original evidence collection. One of the beakers has residue that could be aconitum."

"How did we miss this?"

"Because we weren't looking for it. We found the plants, we found Diana's confession, we stopped digging." I crouched beside the potting station, my phone pressed to my ear. "If we can prove this equipment was purchased by Diana, used to extract the poison, and that the residue matches what was found in Eleanor's system—"

"Then we have physical evidence that corroborates her confession, independent of Sterling's testimony." Margaret's voice sharpened with renewed focus. "I'll get a team there within the hour. And James?"

"Yeah?"

"Good work."

---

The new evidence changed the trajectory of the trial.

On Day Five, Kwan presented the forensic analysis of the beakers. The residue was confirmed as aconitum napellus—the same concentration found in Eleanor's system, the same molecular profile. More damning still, the beakers bore Diana's fingerprints, along with traces of the same brand of gardening gloves found in her bedroom closet.

Malcolm Price fought back, of course. He argued contamination, questioned the chain of custody, suggested that anyone in the house could have used the equipment. But the evidence was too specific, too precise. The jury's skeptical faces from Day Two had shifted toward something harder—not quite conviction, but no longer doubt.

And then came the moment that shattered Diana Ashworth's carefully constructed defense.

Julian Ashworth took the stand.

He looked older than his twenty-two years—the weeks since his arrest had carved new lines around his eyes, new hollows in his cheeks. He'd already pleaded guilty to assault, accepting a reduced sentence in exchange for testimony. Now he sat in the witness box, hands folded, eyes fixed on a point somewhere beyond the gallery.

"Mr. Ashworth," Kwan said gently, "I know this is difficult. But I need you to describe what you observed on the night of December 14th."

Julian swallowed. "I—I was in my room most of the evening. Studying for exams. But around ten o'clock, I came downstairs for coffee."

"And what did you see?"

"My mother was in the kitchen." His voice was barely above a whisper. "She was... she had something in her hands. A small vial, like the kind you'd use for essential oils or—" He stopped, squeezed his eyes shut. "She was adding drops to the tea tray. The one Rosa always prepared for grandmother before bed."

The courtroom erupted. Judge Mills called for order, but the damage was already done. Julian Ashworth had just identified his own mother as the poisoner, not through hearsay or assumption, but through direct observation.

Diana's face went white. For the first time since the trial began, her composure cracked—a flash of betrayal, of fury, of something that might have been grief.

"Julian." Her voice cut through the chaos, sharp enough to silence the gallery. "Julian, look at me."

But Julian Ashworth kept his eyes fixed on that distant point, refusing to meet his mother's gaze. Whatever bond had existed between them—whatever love or loyalty or shared purpose—it had been severed the moment he chose to tell the truth.

---

The prosecution rested the following day. Malcolm Price delivered a closing argument that was technically brilliant and emotionally persuasive, painting Diana as a victim of circumstance, a woman driven to desperate measures by decades of abuse at Eleanor's hands.

But it wasn't enough.

The jury deliberated for six hours. When they returned, the forewoman—a middle-aged accountant who'd shown no emotion throughout the proceedings—read the verdict in a clear, steady voice.

"On the charge of attempted murder in the first degree, we find the defendant guilty."

Diana Ashworth didn't flinch. She stood straight and still as the verdict was read, as the sentencing date was set, as the bailiffs approached to take her into custody. Only when they reached for her hands did she allow herself one final look at the gallery—at Julian, who sat with his head bowed; at the empty seat where Victor should have been; at me, watching from three rows back with Marcus Webb's ring heavy on my finger.

"Detective Marlowe." Her voice carried across the courtroom, freezing everyone in place. "You think this is justice. You think you've won."

I didn't respond. There was nothing to say.

"But you don't understand." Diana's smile was small and cold. "Eleanor Ashworth destroyed everyone who ever loved her. Her husband. Her children. Her grandchildren. She poisoned this family long before I ever touched a plant." The bailiffs were pulling her toward the side door now, but she kept her eyes locked on mine. "All I did was return the favor."

The door closed behind her. The courtroom began to empty. And I sat in my seat, feeling the weight of Marcus's ring on my finger and the cold certainty that Diana Ashworth, for all her crimes, hadn't been entirely wrong.

Eleanor had poisoned this family. In ways visible and invisible, in actions and omissions, through love withheld and hatred freely given. Diana had merely delivered the chemical version of what Eleanor had been administering for fifty years.

Justice had been served. The law had spoken. But as I left the courthouse and stepped into the winter sunlight, I couldn't shake the feeling that we'd only addressed the symptom, not the disease.

The Ashworth poison ran deeper than any toxin. And the verdicts that followed—Julian's, Sterling's, the network members still awaiting their day in court—would only begin to scratch the surface.

But that was tomorrow's problem. Today, the first trial was over. The first verdict had been delivered. And somewhere, I hoped, my grandmother was watching—not with satisfaction, exactly, but with something close to peace.

One down. Many more to go.
