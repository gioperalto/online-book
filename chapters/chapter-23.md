# The Foundation

The secret room felt smaller with Mr. Smith in it.

He moved like a man who had never needed to hurry—each step measured, each gesture economical. The flashlight in my hand caught the planes of his face as he circled toward the computer terminals, and I saw nothing remarkable there. Average features, average build, the kind of face that could disappear into any crowd. The kind of face that was designed to be forgotten.

"You have a choice, Detective." His voice was soft, cultured—the voice of a man who'd spent decades in boardrooms and private clubs, never raising it above a conversational murmur. "You can continue reaching for your weapon, in which case I will be forced to defend myself. Or you can listen to what I have to say." He smiled. "I assure you, the second option is far more productive."

My hand hovered near my holster. The door was sealed behind me, my phone was dead, and I had no backup coming. Whatever happened in this room would stay in this room until someone found my body—or didn't.

"Who are you?"

"That's a more complicated question than you might imagine." He gestured toward a metal chair near the wall. "Please. Sit. We have much to discuss, and standing makes me feel like we're negotiating a hostage situation."

"We are negotiating a hostage situation."

"No, Detective. We're having a conversation between professionals." He folded his hands in front of him with the patience of a man who had all the time in the world. "If I wanted you dead, you would never have made it down those stairs. I could have arranged an accident on the drive over. A gas leak in your apartment. A mugging that turned fatal. The Foundation doesn't leave witnesses, Detective. The fact that you're still breathing suggests we have other plans for you."

I studied him—the calm eyes, the relaxed posture, the absolute certainty that he was in control. This wasn't a man operating from desperation. This was a man who knew exactly where he stood in the hierarchy of power.

"The Foundation," I said. "That's what you call yourselves?"

"It's what we've always called ourselves. Since 1952." He nodded toward the photograph on the wall—the silver-haired man with the plaque reading *Founding Member*. "Henry Ashworth. Eleanor's father-in-law. The man who built the network you've been so diligently dismantling."

"Eleanor's father-in-law?"

"Her late husband's father. Richard Ashworth died in 1969—a boating accident, officially. Henry outlived his son by fifty years." Mr. Smith's expression didn't change, but something flickered in his eyes. "Eleanor married into the Foundation, Detective. She didn't create it. She merely inherited it when Henry passed three years ago."

The pieces were shifting, rearranging themselves into a new pattern. I'd spent weeks thinking of Eleanor as the spider at the center of the web. Now I was being told she was just another strand—powerful, dangerous, but ultimately answerable to something larger.

"If Eleanor didn't control the Foundation, who does?"

"That," Mr. Smith said, "is precisely the question."

---

He sat across from me in the cold light, his hands resting on his knees like a man settling in for a long story.

"The Foundation was established in 1952 by a consortium of Millbrook's most influential families. The Ashworths. The Harpers. The Morrisons." He ticked off the names like items on a shopping list. "Their purpose was simple: mutual protection. They had built their fortunes through methods that wouldn't survive scrutiny, and they needed assurance that their secrets would remain buried."

"A conspiracy."

"A compact. An agreement among equals." Mr. Smith's voice was patient, instructional. "For seventy years, the Foundation has operated according to simple principles. Each family protects the others. Evidence is shared, leverage is maintained, and when one member is threatened, the others respond. It's remarkably effective, as you've discovered."

"You're telling me Morrison and Harper weren't just Eleanor's people. They were Foundation members."

"Third generation, in Morrison's case. His grandfather was one of the original signatories." Mr. Smith tilted his head slightly. "The adjuster you captured? He's been employed by the Foundation since 1976. He's eliminated seventeen threats to our members over the decades—including, yes, Marcus Webb."

The name hit me like a physical blow. Marcus Webb. My great-grandfather. The man whose ring I wore on my finger, whose photograph lived in my grandmother's locket.

"You're admitting to murder."

"I'm providing context." Mr. Smith's voice didn't waver. "Marcus Webb was a threat to the Foundation. He had discovered financial irregularities that could have exposed several families. Eleanor wanted him gone—her personal vendetta made her judgment questionable, frankly—but the Foundation agreed that he needed to be silenced." He spread his hands. "It was business, Detective. Nothing personal."

I thought about all the evidence we'd gathered. The documents in Catherine Webb's files. The records in Eleanor's vault. The testimony of Rosa Martinez and David Sterling. We'd thought we were unraveling one woman's crimes. Instead, we'd been scratching the surface of something far older and far more entrenched.

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because the Foundation is at a crossroads." For the first time, something like emotion crossed Mr. Smith's face—not quite concern, but an awareness that circumstances had changed. "Eleanor's death has created a power vacuum. Morrison and Harper are in custody. The adjuster is incapacitated. Our resources are compromised, our methods are exposed, and your investigation threatens to unravel everything Henry Ashworth spent fifty years building."

"Good."

"Is it?" Mr. Smith leaned forward. "Detective, do you have any idea what happens when a system like this collapses? The Foundation isn't just criminals protecting criminals. We control zoning decisions that keep factories from poisoning neighborhoods. We maintain relationships with labor unions that prevent strikes. We ensure that elections produce candidates who actually know how to govern, rather than populists who promise the impossible."

"You decide who wins elections?"

"We ensure that competent candidates have the resources to compete. There's a difference." Mr. Smith's voice hardened slightly. "You think Millbrook became prosperous by accident? You think the economy thrived because of market forces alone? Every city needs someone managing the chaos, Detective. The only question is whether that management is visible or hidden."

I heard what he was saying. The same justification every tyrant has used since the beginning of time—that control is necessary, that order requires a firm hand, that the ends justify the means. It was the logic Eleanor had used to destroy my grandmother. The logic that had killed Marcus Webb and countless others.

"What do you want from me?"

---

Mr. Smith stood and walked to one of the filing cabinets, pulling a folder from the top drawer.

"The Foundation is prepared to offer you a deal, Detective. Full disclosure of our historical activities in exchange for your cooperation in managing the transition."

"Transition to what?"

"To legitimate operations." He laid the folder on the table between us. "The old methods are no longer sustainable. Too many records, too many witnesses, too much scrutiny from federal agencies. The Foundation needs to evolve—to become something that can operate in daylight rather than shadow."

"You want to go legit."

"We want to survive." Mr. Smith's eyes met mine. "And you, Detective Marlowe, are in a unique position to help us. You have credibility with law enforcement, relationships with the media, access to the evidence that could destroy us. If you were to... manage... how that evidence is disclosed, we could ensure that the prosecution of historical crimes focuses only on the dead and the already-incarcerated."

"You want me to cover up seventy years of murder and corruption."

"I want you to help us write the narrative." His voice was reasonable, persuasive. "Eleanor Ashworth and her immediate associates committed terrible crimes. They'll be held accountable—posthumously, in Eleanor's case. The trials will proceed for Diana, Julian, Sterling, even Morrison and Harper. But the Foundation itself? The infrastructure, the relationships, the resources? Those remain intact, reformed but functional."

I stared at the folder. It was thick, heavy with documents that probably detailed crimes I couldn't imagine. Crimes that would never see the light of day if I accepted his offer.

"And if I refuse?"

Mr. Smith's expression didn't change. "Then we have a problem." He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a phone—not mine, something different, a burner probably. "Your father is at your grandmother's grave right now. He goes there every Sunday at 3 PM. It's a touching routine, really. Predictable."

The threat was casual, almost offhand. The way a man might mention the weather or comment on traffic.

"Margaret Torres is at the FBI field office, reviewing case files. Your ex-wife Sarah is at her mother's care facility in Detroit—visiting hours end at 4 PM." Mr. Smith tucked the phone back into his pocket. "Catherine Webb is beyond our reach now, obviously. But the rest of your family? They're very much available."

"You're threatening to kill my family."

"I'm explaining the stakes." His voice was still soft, still cultured. "The Foundation has protected its members for seventy years. We've survived scandals, investigations, regime changes. We've adapted and evolved and persevered. One detective, no matter how determined, isn't going to bring us down." He gestured toward the sealed door. "Your choice, Detective. Work with us and help build something better. Or resist, and watch everyone you love disappear."

---

BUT the thing about ultimatums is that they only work on people who believe them.

I'd spent twenty-six years as a cop. I'd faced down killers and kingpins and men who thought their money made them untouchable. I'd learned one fundamental truth: people who make threats are usually bluffing.

Mr. Smith wasn't bluffing. I could see it in his eyes, in the casual way he'd listed my family members and their locations. The Foundation had the resources and the will to follow through. If I walked out of this room without agreeing to his terms, people I loved would start dying.

But I also knew something else. The Foundation was scared.

They'd operated in shadow for seventy years, immune to scrutiny, protected by their web of influence and corruption. Now that web was tearing. Morrison and Harper were in custody. The adjuster was captured. The *Detroit Free Press* had published the first of what would be many exposés. Federal investigators were circling.

Mr. Smith wasn't here to negotiate from strength. He was here because the Foundation was hemorrhaging, and they needed me to help stop the bleeding.

Which meant I had leverage.

"I want to see the files," I said.

"I'm sorry?"

"The files. The evidence. Whatever you have on Foundation activities going back to 1952." I gestured toward the filing cabinets lining the walls. "If you want me to manage the narrative, I need to know what I'm managing."

Mr. Smith studied me for a long moment. I could see the calculations happening behind his eyes—the risk assessment, the evaluation of my intentions.

"That's a significant request."

"You're asking me to betray everything I've sworn to uphold. The least you can do is show me what I'm protecting."

Another pause. Then he nodded slowly. "Very well. But I should warn you, Detective—the Foundation's history is not pleasant reading. Some of what you'll see will challenge your understanding of how power works in this country."

"I've had my understanding challenged before."

He walked to the largest filing cabinet—a steel monster that looked like it could survive a nuclear blast—and pulled a key from his pocket. The lock clicked, and the drawer slid open to reveal rows of manila folders, each labeled with a date range.

"Help yourself." He stepped back. "I'll give you thirty minutes. After that, we'll need your answer."

---

The files told a story I hadn't been prepared to hear.

Not just Millbrook. The Foundation's reach extended far beyond this city—into state government, federal agencies, corporate boardrooms. I found records of campaign contributions that had shaped elections across three decades. Evidence of judicial appointments that had been arranged rather than earned. Documentation of business deals that had enriched Foundation families while destroying competitors.

And deaths. So many deaths.

Marcus Webb was one of seventeen documented eliminations between 1960 and 1990. Each file contained the same structure: a description of the threat, an assessment of options, a decision memo, and a final report confirming resolution. The language was bureaucratic, bloodless—the same kind of language you might find in a corporate HR document.

*Subject demonstrated continued interest in financial irregularities despite warnings. Risk of exposure deemed unacceptable. Resolution: workplace accident, Seattle, March 1964. Status: Complete.*

That was my great-grandfather. Reduced to a status update in a folder.

I kept reading. My grandmother's file was thinner—she'd been monitored rather than eliminated, her threat level deemed manageable as long as she remained silent. The Foundation had considered killing her after she confronted Eleanor but had decided the risk of attracting attention outweighed the benefit.

*Subject is deteriorating mentally and physically. Natural resolution anticipated within 5 years. Recommend continued observation only.*

She'd died of a heart attack three days later. The timing, I now realized, wasn't coincidental.

There were files on current Foundation members too. Judge Harper's payoff records going back to her first appointment. Morrison's role in covering up at least twelve homicides. Caldwell's involvement in land deals that had displaced hundreds of families.

And at the bottom of one drawer, almost hidden beneath older documents, I found a file labeled simply: *Marlowe, James*.

---

My file was forty-three pages long.

They'd been watching me since I joined the force in 1998. Every case I'd worked, every commendation I'd received, every relationship I'd maintained. My marriage to Sarah. Our divorce. My estrangement from my father. The photograph I kept face-down on my kitchen table.

*Subject demonstrates strong investigative instincts but limited ambition. Has avoided politically sensitive cases throughout career, possibly due to unconscious awareness of family connection to Ashworth interests. Recommend continued observation but no action.*

That was from 2010. More recent entries were less sanguine.

*Subject has been assigned to Ashworth homicide. Risk assessment: HIGH. Subject's family connection to Webb family creates potential for emotional involvement and escalation. Recommend immediate intervention if subject begins pursuing network connections.*

*Update: Subject has made contact with Catherine Webb. Risk level: CRITICAL. Recommend activation of contingency protocols.*

The contingency protocols were outlined on the next page. My father would have been the first to die. Then Margaret. Then Rosa Martinez. Then anyone else who could corroborate the evidence against the Foundation.

They'd been planning to kill everyone I cared about. The only reason they hadn't done it was because events had moved too quickly—the FBI involvement, the *Detroit Free Press* story, the collapse of the network.

Now they were trying to negotiate instead.

"Thirty minutes are up, Detective."

Mr. Smith had appeared beside me, silent as a shadow. I hadn't heard him approach.

"I've seen enough."

"And your decision?"

I closed the folder and set it back in the drawer. My hands were steady. My voice was calm. Everything I felt—the rage, the grief, the desperate need to put a bullet through this man's forehead—stayed locked behind a wall I'd spent decades building.

"I have a counter-offer."

---

THEREFORE, I laid out my terms.

"The Foundation turns over all historical records—every file, every document, every piece of evidence dating back to 1952. Full disclosure, nothing held back."

"That would destroy us."

"No. It would destroy the old Foundation." I met his eyes. "You said you wanted to transition to legitimate operations. This is how you do it. Full transparency. Complete accountability for past crimes."

"The families would never agree—"

"The families are going to prison anyway. Morrison, Caldwell, Harper—they're already in custody. The adjuster will testify to save what's left of his life. Sterling's already cooperating." I stepped closer, close enough to see the first flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. "The Foundation isn't going to survive this, Mr. Smith. The only question is whether it collapses in an orderly fashion or explodes in a way that takes everyone down."

"And what would you gain from an orderly collapse?"

"Closure." The word felt inadequate, but it was the only one I had. "I want the truth—all of it—entered into the public record. I want the victims acknowledged. I want the families who've been terrorized for decades to finally know what happened to their loved ones."

"And in exchange?"

"In exchange, I recommend that federal prosecutors focus on the living rather than the dead. The families who committed crimes decades ago but who are no longer active—their descendants face civil liability but not criminal charges. The Foundation's assets are liquidated, the proceeds go to victims' restitution funds, and the organization itself is formally dissolved."

Mr. Smith was silent for a long moment. I could see him turning the proposal over in his mind, examining it from every angle.

"You're asking us to commit institutional suicide."

"I'm offering you a way to die with dignity instead of being hunted to extinction." I gestured toward the files. "The FBI already has most of this. The *Detroit Free Press* has more. Catherine Webb's book will be published within six months, and it contains enough documentation to keep investigators busy for a decade. The Foundation is already dead, Mr. Smith. You just haven't admitted it yet."

"And if I refuse your terms?"

"Then I walk out of here, and I tell Margaret Torres everything. The secret room. The files. Your location. Within an hour, this place will be crawling with federal agents, and you'll spend the rest of your life in a supermax facility wondering if you made the right choice."

"You'd never make it to the door."

"Maybe not." I let my hand rest near my weapon. "But you won't walk out of here either. I'm not the kind of detective who dies quietly, Mr. Smith. You kill me, and every cop in this state will be hunting you. My father will come for you. My aunt will bring the full weight of the FBI down on everything you've ever touched." I smiled. "I'm worth more to you alive than dead. We both know it."

The silence stretched between us. I could hear my own heartbeat, steady and slow.

Finally, Mr. Smith nodded.

"I'll need to consult with the remaining members. Your proposal is... unorthodox, but not without merit." He pulled a card from his pocket—plain white, expensive stock, a phone number in black ink. "I'll contact you within forty-eight hours with a decision."

"And my family?"

"They'll remain safe while negotiations are ongoing. You have my word."

"Your word isn't worth much."

"No. But my pragmatism is." He moved toward the secret door, pressing something I couldn't see. The wall swung open, revealing the dark wine cellar beyond. "The Foundation survives by being practical, Detective. Right now, cooperating with you is more practical than killing you. That could change, of course. But for the moment, you have my assurance."

He paused at the threshold, his silhouette framed by the darkness.

"One more thing. Patricia Webb—Eleanor's niece—she's been trying to contact you. I'd suggest you speak with her. She has information about the Foundation that even we don't have. Her mother kept records too, you see. Records that Eleanor tried very hard to destroy."

Then he was gone, dissolving into the shadows like he'd never been there at all.

---

I emerged from the wine cellar into the gray light of late afternoon.

The Ashworth estate was still quiet, still empty—but it felt different now. The mansion that had loomed over Millbrook for four generations was no longer just a crime scene. It was a monument to something far larger and far older than Eleanor Ashworth.

My phone powered back on as I crossed the threshold, and messages flooded in. Margaret asking where I was. My father checking in. Kwan with updates on the trial schedule.

And one unknown number, three words:

*We should talk. -P*

Patricia Webb. Eleanor's niece. The woman who'd tried to turn Sterling, who'd appeared out of nowhere with photographs and warnings.

I pocketed the phone and walked to my car. The winter light was fading, and I had a lot of calls to make. Margaret needed to know about the Foundation. The FBI needed to search this wine cellar. And somewhere in Millbrook, Patricia Webb was waiting with secrets that might be the key to everything.

The Foundation had given me forty-eight hours. I intended to use every minute of them.

But as I drove away from the Ashworth estate, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd just made a deal with the devil. Mr. Smith had agreed to negotiate—but negotiating wasn't the same as surrendering. The Foundation had survived for seventy years by being ruthless, adaptable, and patient.

They'd survive this too if I wasn't careful.

The question was whether I could dismantle them before they dismantled me.

---

I found Patricia Webb at a bar on the east side of Millbrook—the kind of place where the regulars minded their own business and the staff knew better than to ask questions.

She was sitting in a back booth, nursing a whiskey neat, her silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. When I slid into the seat across from her, she didn't look surprised.

"You met him. Mr. Smith." It wasn't a question.

"How did you know?"

"Because he always meets with the ones who matter." She took a sip of her whiskey. "I've been watching the Foundation since I was nineteen years old, Detective. I know their playbook better than they do."

"Then you know he offered me a deal."

"Of course. Cooperation in exchange for controlled disclosure." She set down her glass. "The same deal they offered my mother thirty years ago. The same deal they'll offer anyone who threatens their existence."

"Your mother?"

"Margaret Webb. Eleanor's sister." Patricia's voice was flat, carefully controlled. "She found out about the Foundation when she was pregnant with me. Her husband—my father—was a third cousin of Marcus Webb. Not close enough to matter, ordinarily, but Eleanor was paranoid. She saw the marriage as a betrayal."

"What happened?"

"Eleanor gave my mother a choice. Stay quiet and be allowed to live on the fringes of the family, or speak up and be erased." Patricia's jaw tightened. "My mother chose silence. But she also chose documentation. For twenty years, she kept records—copies of Foundation documents, photographs, recordings. She was building a case, just like Catherine Webb. Just like me."

"Where are those records now?"

"Hidden. Safe." Patricia met my eyes. "My mother died when I was twelve. Eleanor told me it was a heart attack. I didn't learn the truth until I was in my twenties, when I found her files hidden in a storage unit she'd rented under a false name."

The pattern was becoming clear. The Foundation had been hemorrhaging for decades, leaking secrets through the cracks in its control. Catherine Webb, Rosa Martinez, Margaret Webb, Sarah Marlowe—women who had been victimized, who had survived, who had documented everything they knew.

"What do you want from me?"

"The same thing you want. The Foundation destroyed, the truth exposed, the victims acknowledged." Patricia leaned forward. "But I also want something they can't offer you. I want the families to fall. Not just the individuals—Morrison, Harper, the adjuster—but the entire network. The children and grandchildren who inherited wealth built on murder. The institutions that laundered their money and protected their reputations."

"That's not how the law works. You can't punish people for their ancestors' crimes."

"No. But you can expose them. You can make sure everyone knows where their money came from, what their grandparents did to earn it." Her eyes burned with decades of suppressed rage. "You think the Ashworth fortune should pass to Julian? You think Morrison's children should inherit his pension? They're not innocent, Detective. They benefited from crimes. They should face the consequences."

I thought about Julian Ashworth, sitting in a courtroom waiting to learn his fate. He'd tried to strangle his grandmother. He'd also been raised in a family that had twisted everyone who entered it. Was he a monster or a victim? Both, probably. Like everyone else touched by Eleanor's legacy.

"I can't promise you revenge, Patricia. But I can promise you the truth."

"The truth is a good start." She finished her whiskey and stood. "I'll send you my mother's files. Everything she collected, everything I've added over the years. Use it however you see fit."

"And Mr. Smith? The Foundation's offer?"

Patricia paused, her coat half-on. "The Foundation doesn't negotiate in good faith, Detective. They've never surrendered anything they didn't plan to take back later. Whatever deal they're offering you, assume they're planning to break it the moment you're no longer useful."

Then she was gone, leaving me alone with an empty booth and a decision that would determine everything.

The Foundation wanted my cooperation. Patricia wanted my vengeance. The FBI wanted my evidence. My father wanted my forgiveness.

Everyone wanted something from James Marlowe.

The question was what I wanted for myself.

---

Forty-seven hours later, Mr. Smith called.

"The Foundation has considered your proposal," he said. "We're prepared to accept your terms—with modifications."

"What modifications?"

"The historical records will be turned over to the FBI, as you requested. Civil liability for descendant families is acceptable. But we require assurances that certain... ongoing operations... will be allowed to continue."

"What operations?"

"Nothing illegal, I assure you. Charitable foundations. Community development initiatives. The kind of work that benefits everyone." His voice was smooth, reasonable. "The Foundation may be dissolving, but its members still have resources and influence. We'd prefer to use those resources constructively."

I heard what he wasn't saying. The families wanted to survive. They wanted to keep their wealth, their status, their positions of power. The Foundation's explicit activities would end, but the network—the relationships, the favors, the quiet influence—would continue in some form.

It wasn't justice. But it might be the best I could get.

"I need to see the specific terms in writing."

"Of course. I'll have documents delivered to your office within the hour." A pause. "Detective Marlowe, I want you to understand something. The Foundation has existed for seventy years because it serves a purpose. Chaos is the enemy of civilization. Someone has to maintain order, even if the methods are sometimes... unpleasant."

"That's what Eleanor believed."

"Eleanor was a symptom, not the disease. The disease is human nature itself—the greed, the ambition, the willingness to do terrible things for personal gain." Mr. Smith's voice was almost philosophical. "The Foundation attempted to channel those impulses toward stability. Perhaps we failed. Perhaps our methods became as corrupt as the problems we tried to solve. But the underlying need doesn't disappear just because we do."

"I'll read your documents," I said. "And then I'll make my decision."

I hung up before he could respond.

---

The documents arrived as promised—a thick manila envelope delivered by a courier who didn't ask for a signature. Inside, I found exactly what Mr. Smith had described: a proposal for the orderly dissolution of the Foundation.

Historical records dating back to 1952 would be transferred to FBI custody. Civil lawsuits would be permitted against surviving family members. Criminal prosecution would focus on individuals already in custody. And the Foundation's remaining assets—approximately $47 million in various holdings—would be placed in a trust for victims' restitution.

It was neat. It was clean. It was almost certainly a trap.

I called Margaret.

"I need you to meet me at the estate. Bring whoever you trust from the field office."

"What's happening?"

"I'm about to blow up everything."

---

The wine cellar was emptier than I remembered—Mr. Smith had removed some of the files, I noticed, leaving gaps in the cabinets that told their own story.

But enough remained. Enough to prove the Foundation's existence, to document seventy years of corruption, to identify the families who had profited from murder and intimidation.

Margaret stood beside me, her face pale as she leafed through the pages.

"This goes all the way to the state capital. Maybe higher."

"I know."

"If we pursue this—if we really pursue this—we're going to make enemies we can't even imagine."

"I know that too."

She set down the folder she'd been reading—Marcus Webb's file, I noticed—and turned to face me.

"Why are you doing this, James? The Foundation offered you a deal. You could have walked away, protected your family, let the old crimes stay buried."

I thought about the question. About my grandmother and Marcus Webb. About Catherine, who had died smiling because she'd finally seen the truth emerge. About my father, who had carried secrets for fifty years because he thought it was the only way to survive.

"Because the truth matters," I said finally. "Not just for justice, not just for the victims. For everyone who comes after. If we let the Foundation survive—even in a reformed version—we're telling the world that power protects itself. That enough money and influence can bury any crime."

"And you want to prove them wrong."

"I want to try." I met her eyes. "I'm probably going to fail. There are people in those files who have more resources than the FBI, more connections than any prosecutor. They'll fight back. They'll find ways to discredit us, to delay proceedings, to make the truth disappear again."

"But you want to try anyway."

"That's all any of us can do. Try." I picked up Marcus Webb's file and held it against my chest. "Catherine Webb tried for forty years. Rosa Martinez tried. My grandmother tried, in her own way. They passed the fight to us. The least we can do is carry it a little further."

Margaret was silent for a long moment. Then she pulled out her phone and started making calls.

"I need a full forensic team at the Ashworth estate. Bring everything. We're going to be here for a while."

---

The Foundation's response came three days later.

Not violence—they'd learned that violence only creates martyrs. Instead, they deployed lawyers. Teams of them, filing motions and injunctions, challenging warrants and demanding recusals. The litigation was designed to delay, to exhaust, to make the pursuit of justice so expensive and time-consuming that everyone would eventually give up.

It didn't work.

The *Detroit Free Press* ran a second story, then a third. Other papers picked up the coverage. The Foundation's attempts at suppression only generated more attention, more scrutiny, more pressure.

By the end of the month, seven more Foundation members had been arrested. The FBI had opened investigations in three states. And Julian Ashworth's motion to dismiss had been denied—Judge Thompson ruling that Detective Marlowe's family connection, while unusual, did not invalidate evidence collected through proper procedures.

The trials would proceed.

The Foundation would fall.

And somewhere in the wine cellar of the Ashworth estate, the photograph of Henry Ashworth—*Founding Member, 1952-2019, "The Foundation Endures"*—watched over the empty filing cabinets that had once held seventy years of secrets.

The Foundation would not endure.

That much, at least, I could guarantee.
