# Some ghosts you have to face

Millbrook sits in a cradle of low hills where the Thorne River bends south toward the coast. It's the kind of town that looks picturesque from a distance—church steeples rising above autumn maples, Victorian storefronts lining a cobblestone Main Street, the silver thread of water catching the light as it winds past the old shipping docks. Postcards and tourist brochures love Millbrook. They don't mention the rust eating at the warehouse district or the way the river fog settles into the streets like something hiding. They don't talk about the names that matter here, the families whose money built those steeples and whose influence decides which businesses thrive and which quietly close their doors.

I've lived here my whole life, excepting four years of college and a brief stint with the state police that ended when my grandmother got sick. Came back to take care of her, joined the Millbrook PD, never left. Fifty-two years, and I still can't decide if this town is home or a trap I never figured out how to escape.

The old-timers at the station still talk about my early years like they were something mythical. Back then, the top brass had a habit of handing me the cases nobody else wanted—the unsolvables, the cold ones, the political landmines that could end careers. I think they were testing me. Or maybe hoping I'd fail spectacularly enough to justify showing me the door. But the Kellerman kidnapping in '99 broke open when I found the connection to the victim's piano teacher. The dockside murders in 2003 unraveled after I spent three weeks sleeping in my car, watching the shipping manifests. The Patterson disappearance, the Thornwood arsons, the string of pharmacy robberies that had the DEA chasing their tails—one by one, I cracked them all. After a while, they stopped handing me impossible cases to fail and started handing them to me because they knew I wouldn't.

That was a long time ago. These days, my reputation precedes me in this small town more than my actual abilities. People remember the detective I used to be, not the tired man I've become. But in Millbrook, memory has a way of outlasting reality.

My house is a narrow Victorian on Elm Street, three blocks from the river. The kind of place that was beautiful once, before decades of deferred maintenance turned character into decay. The porch lists slightly to the left. The paint is peeling in places I keep meaning to address. The heating system makes sounds that a younger man would investigate, but I've learned to live with the groans and clanks. It's just the house settling, I tell myself. Just the bones complaining about the cold.

Tonight the cold had settled into those bones with a particular persistence. November in Millbrook means frost on the windows by midnight, means pulling the wool blanket from the closet and still waking up with stiff joints. I'd given up on sleep around two in the morning, padding downstairs to the kitchen in bare feet that complained about the cold floorboards.

The bourbon was a habit I couldn't seem to break. Not the drinking—I'd poured myself a glass and set it on the table, where it sat untouched, the amber liquid catching the light from the single bulb over the stove. It was the ritual that mattered. The weight of the glass in my hand. The sharp smell of it cutting through the stillness of the house. Sometimes you need something to hold onto at three in the morning when the silence presses in and the memories won't stay buried.

The photograph lay face-down on the table in front of me. I'd taken it out of the drawer an hour ago, turned it over just once, then set it face-down again. A reflex, like touching a hot stove. Some things you can't look at for too long.

Outside, a car passed on the empty street, its headlights sweeping across the ceiling before disappearing. The refrigerator hummed its steady drone. The house creaked. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a dog barked once and fell silent. Millbrook at three in the morning, holding its breath.

The kitchen still smelled faintly of the coffee I'd made earlier, when I'd first given up on sleep. The mug sat in the sink, next to dishes I'd wash tomorrow. Or the next day. Living alone has a way of lowering your standards. My ex-wife used to keep this place spotless, or as spotless as a hundred-year-old house can be. After she left, the dust started accumulating in the corners, the dishes piled up a little longer, the yard went from neat to tolerable to what the neighbors probably called an eyesore. I'd stopped caring around the same time I stopped sleeping through the night.

Three years now. Three years since Sarah walked out, three years since I'd spoken to her, three years of silence that had calcified into something neither of us knew how to break. The bourbon in my glass caught the light. I didn't drink it. I just sat there in the dark of my kitchen, in the cold of my old house, in the quiet of a town that had never felt like it belonged to me.

The phone rang at 3:47 in the morning.

I know the exact time because my eyes had drifted to the clock on the stove just before the shrill sound shattered the silence. I let it ring twice before reaching for it, some part of me already knowing that whatever waited on the other end wasn't going to be good. Phones don't ring at this hour with happy news.

"Detective Marlowe?" The voice on the other end was young, trembling slightly. Probably a rookie working the overnight shift at the precinct.

"Speaking." I set down the photograph. Face down, as if that made any difference. I reached for a pen out of habit.

"There's been a murder, sir. Captain Reyes wants you at the scene immediately. It's the Ashworth estate."

I felt something cold settle in my chest, a familiar weight I hadn't felt in three years. The Ashworth estate. Of course it was.

"I'll be there in twenty minutes."

I hung up and sat motionless for a long moment, listening to the silence of my kitchen. The refrigerator hummed its steady drone. Another car passed on the street outside, its headlights sweeping briefly across the ceiling before disappearing. I finished the bourbon in one swallow—waste not, want not—and reached for my jacket.

The drive through the empty streets of Millbrook gave me time I didn't want. Down Elm to River Road, past the shuttered storefronts of the old downtown, across the iron bridge that had been promising to collapse for as long as I could remember. The traffic lights cycled through their colors for an audience of no one, and I stopped at each red like the good citizen I pretended to be. The radio muttered something about overnight temperatures and weekend forecasts. I turned it off.

Time to think, to remember. The Ashworth family had ruled this town for four generations, their money built on shipping and their influence built on secrets. The shipping docks bore their name. So did the library, the hospital wing, the park by the river where kids played on swings bought with Ashworth money. Everyone in Millbrook owed them something: a favor, a debt, a grudge. I owed them more than most.

At the iron gates of the estate, a uniformed officer waved me through after checking my badge. The driveway wound through ancient oaks for nearly a quarter mile before the house itself appeared through the fog like something out of a Gothic novel, all sharp angles and darkened windows. A dozen police cars already cluttered the circular driveway, their lights painting the stone facade in alternating washes of red and blue. I found a spot behind the coroner's van, killed the engine, and sat for a moment listening to it tick as it cooled. Then I straightened my tie in the rearview mirror. The face looking back at me was tired, creased with the kind of lines that come from too many late nights and not enough reasons to see the morning.

Captain Maria Reyes met me at the front door, her silver-streaked hair pulled back in a severe bun, her expression grim. We'd worked together for fifteen years, and I'd seen that look only a handful of times. Never for anything good.

"It's bad, Marlowe."

"It's always bad, Maria. That's why they call us."

She didn't smile at the weak attempt at humor. Instead, she handed me a pair of latex gloves and led me through the marble foyer, past the sweeping staircase where old portraits of dead Ashworths watched our passage with oil-painted disapproval.

"The victim is Eleanor Ashworth," Reyes said, her voice low. We walked as she talked, our footsteps echoing in the cavernous foyer. "The matriarch. Seventy-three years old, found in the library by her housekeeper around three this morning."

Eleanor. I felt the cold weight in my chest grow heavier. Eleanor, with her silver hair and sharp tongue and secrets that could topple dynasties.

"Cause of death?"

"That's where it gets complicated." Reyes stopped outside a set of ornate double doors, their dark wood carved with images of ships at sea. "She was poisoned. But someone also strangled her. And there's a letter opener embedded in her chest."

I let that sink in for a moment, the sheer improbability of it. "Someone really wanted her dead."

"Or multiple someones." Reyes pushed open the doors. "Welcome to the circus, Detective."

The library was magnificent in the way only old money can achieve. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, leather furniture worn soft by generations of use, a fireplace large enough to roast a pig. But my eyes went immediately to the figure slumped in the high-backed chair near the window.

Eleanor Ashworth had been a formidable woman in life. In death, she looked smaller somehow, diminished. Her white silk dressing gown was stained dark with blood from the letter opener protruding from her chest. Purple bruises ringed her throat like a grotesque necklace. And on the end table beside her, a teacup lay overturned. Its contents. Whatever poison they'd contained. Soaked into the Persian rug.

"Three methods," I murmured, circling the body without touching anything. "Poison, strangulation, stabbing. Either we've got the most thorough killer in criminal history, or."

"Or we've got multiple killers," Reyes finished. "Each with their own reason to want her dead."

I knelt beside the chair, my knees protesting even that simple motion, and studied Eleanor's face. Her eyes were closed. Someone had done that, maybe the housekeeper—a small mercy in a room full of horrors. A grandfather clock in the corner ticked steadily, marking time that no longer mattered to the woman in the chair. Her expression was almost peaceful, at odds with the violence done to her body.

"Who was in the house tonight?"

Reyes flipped open her notepad, the pages rustling softly in the otherwise silent room. "The full roster. Her son, Victor, and his wife, Diana. Her daughter, Margot. Her grandson, Julian, home from law school for the weekend. The housekeeper, Rosa Martinez—she's the one who found the body. Been with the family thirty-five years. The groundskeeper, Thomas Chen, lives in the cottage out back, maybe two hundred yards from the main house. And get this—Eleanor's personal attorney, David Sterling, was here for dinner and stayed the night in one of the guest rooms. East wing. Apparently they had business to discuss."

"At her age, 'business to discuss' usually means one thing."

"The will." Reyes nodded. "We're working on getting a copy."

I stood, my knees protesting the movement. At fifty-two, the job was getting harder on my body than I liked to admit. "Who inherits?"

"That's the question, isn't it? From what I understand, Eleanor was unpredictable with her money. Changed her will more often than most people change their sheets."

Something caught my eye. A glint of gold near Eleanor's right hand, which hung limply over the arm of the chair. I leaned closer and felt my stomach drop.

It was a locket. Small, heart-shaped, with a delicate chain tangled between her cold fingers.

I knew that locket. I'd seen it a thousand times, always hanging around a different neck.

"Marlowe?" Reyes's voice seemed to come from very far away. "You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

"I'm fine," I said, straightening up. "I need to interview everyone in the house. Starting with the son."

"Victor's in the drawing room. Fair warning. He's already called his lawyer and is threatening to sue the department for harassment." Reyes snorted. "His mother's body is still warm, and he's already playing politics."

"That's the Ashworths for you."

I took one last look at Eleanor, at the locket clutched in her dead hand, at the three distinct methods someone had used to end her life. A crime scene photographer's flash went off somewhere behind me, freezing the moment in harsh white light. Three methods, seven suspects, and a family whose secrets ran deeper than the foundations of this house.

The dawn was beginning to break through the library windows, painting the room in shades of pink and gold. It should have been beautiful. Instead, it just illuminated the horror more clearly. The blood, the bruises, the utter stillness of death.

I thought about the photograph still lying face-down on my kitchen table. About the bourbon I'd left undrunk. About the three years I'd spent trying to forget everything the Ashworth name meant to me.

And I knew, with a certainty that settled into my bones like winter cold, that this case was going to destroy me.

But I also knew I couldn't walk away.

Some ghosts, you have to face.
