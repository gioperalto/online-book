## A New Journey

Every story has a beginning, and this is ours. The markdown content supports all standard markdown features including:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Lists like this one

### Formatting Examples

You can include code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, reader!");
}
```

You can also include blockquotes:

> "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
> — Lao Tzu

And of course, regular paragraphs with [links](https://example.com) and `inline code`.

## Continuing the Story

Add as much content as you need for each chapter. The reader interface will automatically format everything beautifully.
