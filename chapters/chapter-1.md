# Chapter One

The phone call came at 3:47 in the morning, that ungodly hour when the world holds its breath between night and dawn. I know the exact time because I was already awake, sitting in my kitchen with a glass of bourbon I had no intention of drinking, staring at a photograph I had no business keeping.

"Detective Marlowe?" The voice on the other end was young, trembling slightly. Probably a rookie working the overnight shift at the precinct.

"Speaking." I set down the photograph—face down, as if that made any difference—and reached for a pen out of habit.

"There's been a murder, sir. Captain Reyes wants you at the scene immediately. It's... it's the Ashworth estate."

I felt something cold settle in my chest, a familiar weight I hadn't felt in three years. The Ashworth estate. Of course it was.

"I'll be there in twenty minutes."

The drive through the empty streets of Millbrook gave me time I didn't want—time to think, to remember. The Ashworth family had ruled this town for four generations, their money built on shipping and their influence built on secrets. Everyone in Millbrook owed them something: a favor, a debt, a grudge. I owed them more than most.

The estate appeared through the fog like something out of a Gothic novel, all sharp angles and darkened windows. A dozen police cars already cluttered the circular driveway, their lights painting the stone facade in alternating washes of red and blue. I parked behind the coroner's van and took a moment to straighten my tie in the rearview mirror. The face looking back at me was tired, creased with the kind of lines that come from too many late nights and not enough reasons to see the morning.

*Get it together, James,* I told myself. *It's just another case.*

But even as I thought it, I knew it was a lie.

Captain Maria Reyes met me at the front door, her silver-streaked hair pulled back in a severe bun, her expression grim. We'd worked together for fifteen years, and I'd seen that look only a handful of times—never for anything good.

"It's bad, Marlowe."

"It's always bad, Maria. That's why they call us."

She didn't smile at the weak attempt at humor. Instead, she handed me a pair of latex gloves and led me through the marble foyer, past the sweeping staircase where old portraits of dead Ashworths watched our passage with oil-painted disapproval.

"The victim is Eleanor Ashworth," Reyes said, her voice low. "The matriarch. Seventy-three years old, found in the library by her housekeeper around three this morning."

Eleanor. I felt the cold weight in my chest grow heavier. Eleanor, with her silver hair and sharp tongue and secrets that could topple dynasties.

"Cause of death?"

"That's where it gets complicated." Reyes stopped outside a set of ornate double doors, their dark wood carved with images of ships at sea. "She was poisoned. But someone also strangled her. And there's a letter opener embedded in her chest."

I stared at her. "Someone really wanted her dead."

"Or multiple someones." Reyes pushed open the doors. "Welcome to the circus, Detective."

The library was magnificent in the way only old money can achieve—floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, leather furniture worn soft by generations of use, a fireplace large enough to roast a pig. But my eyes went immediately to the figure slumped in the high-backed chair near the window.

Eleanor Ashworth had been a formidable woman in life. In death, she looked smaller somehow, diminished. Her white silk dressing gown was stained dark with blood from the letter opener protruding from her chest. Purple bruises ringed her throat like a grotesque necklace. And on the end table beside her, a teacup lay overturned, its contents—and whatever poison they'd contained—soaked into the Persian rug.

"Three methods," I murmured, circling the body without touching anything. "Poison, strangulation, stabbing. Either we've got the most thorough killer in criminal history, or—"

"Or we've got multiple killers," Reyes finished. "Each with their own reason to want her dead."

I knelt beside the chair, studying Eleanor's face. Her eyes were closed—someone had done that, maybe the housekeeper—but her expression was almost peaceful, at odds with the violence done to her body.

"Who was in the house tonight?"

Reyes flipped open her notepad. "The full roster. Her son, Victor, and his wife, Diana. Her daughter, Margot. Her grandson, Julian, home from law school for the weekend. The housekeeper, Rosa Martinez—she's the one who found the body. The groundskeeper, Thomas Chen, lives in the cottage out back. And get this—Eleanor's personal attorney, David Sterling, was here for dinner and stayed the night in one of the guest rooms. Apparently they had business to discuss."

"At her age, 'business to discuss' usually means one thing."

"The will." Reyes nodded. "We're working on getting a copy."

I stood, my knees protesting the movement. At fifty-two, the job was getting harder on my body than I liked to admit. "Who inherits?"

"That's the question, isn't it? From what I understand, Eleanor was... unpredictable with her money. Changed her will more often than most people change their sheets."

Something caught my eye—a glint of gold near Eleanor's right hand, which hung limply over the arm of the chair. I leaned closer and felt my stomach drop.

It was a locket. Small, heart-shaped, with a delicate chain tangled between her cold fingers.

I knew that locket. I'd seen it a thousand times, always hanging around a different neck.

"Marlowe?" Reyes's voice seemed to come from very far away. "You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

*Maybe I have,* I thought. *Maybe I have.*

"I'm fine," I said, straightening up. "I need to interview everyone in the house. Starting with the son."

"Victor's in the drawing room. Fair warning—he's already called his lawyer and is threatening to sue the department for harassment." Reyes snorted. "His mother's body is still warm, and he's already playing politics."

"That's the Ashworths for you."

I took one last look at Eleanor, at the locket clutched in her dead hand, at the three distinct methods someone had used to end her life. Three methods, seven suspects, and a family whose secrets ran deeper than the foundations of this house.

*What did you know, Eleanor?* I wondered. *What did you know, and who did you tell?*

The dawn was beginning to break through the library windows, painting the room in shades of pink and gold. It should have been beautiful. Instead, it just illuminated the horror more clearly—the blood, the bruises, the utter stillness of death.

I thought about the photograph still lying face-down on my kitchen table. About the bourbon I'd left undrunk. About the three years I'd spent trying to forget everything the Ashworth name meant to me.

And I knew, with a certainty that settled into my bones like winter cold, that this case was going to destroy me.

But I also knew I couldn't walk away.

Some ghosts, you have to face.
