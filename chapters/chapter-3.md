# Final Words

David Sterling had the practiced calm of a man who made his living navigating other people's disasters. I found him in the formal dining room—it took me a few wrong turns through the labyrinthine corridors before a uniformed officer pointed me in the right direction. The room where the Ashworth family had shared their final meal together just hours before still bore traces of the evening: a wine stain on the white tablecloth, a crystal saltshaker slightly out of place. Sterling sat at the head of the table, his silver hair perfectly combed, his charcoal suit immaculate despite the chaos of the morning. A leather briefcase rested on the table beside him. His hands were folded neatly in front of him. Steady. Uncallused. The hands of someone who'd never done physical labor.

"Detective Marlowe." He rose when I entered, extending one of those manicured hands. "David Sterling. I assumed you'd want to speak with me."

His grip was firm but brief, the handshake of a man who'd calibrated every gesture for maximum efficiency. I took the seat across from him and pulled out my notebook, though we both knew this conversation would require more than notes.

"You were Eleanor's personal attorney," I said. It wasn't a question.

"For thirty-seven years." Something flickered in his eyes. Grief, maybe. Or something more complicated. "She hired me straight out of law school. Said she could smell ambition and preferred to train her people from scratch."

"Her people."

Sterling's lips thinned. "Eleanor was particular about loyalty. She surrounded herself with individuals she'd shaped. Molded. People who owed their careers to her and knew it."

"People who couldn't say no."

"People who chose not to." He held my gaze without flinching. "There's a difference, Detective, though I don't expect you to understand it."

I let the silence stretch between us, watching his composure. David Sterling was good. Polished in a way that came from decades of boardrooms and courtrooms. But everyone had cracks. Everyone.

I'd learned that lesson early in my career, back when the brass was still testing me with impossible cases. The Harrison embezzlement case in 2001—the suspect was a former federal prosecutor with connections all the way to the state capital. Everyone said I'd never crack him. But three days of interviews later, I'd found his tell: he touched his wedding ring whenever he lied. By the end of the week, he was confessing to crimes we hadn't even known about. Sterling had his own tells. The way his fingers tightened around his coffee cup. The slight pause before answering certain questions. After twenty-six years of interrogating Millbrook's finest liars, I could read the signs.

"Tell me about last night."

Sterling reached for the cup of coffee that had appeared at his elbow. The housekeeper's doing, probably. He took a measured sip before answering. "I arrived around five in the afternoon. The drive from my office takes about forty minutes without traffic—there was some construction on Route 9 that added another fifteen. Eleanor had asked me to come for dinner and to stay overnight. She said she had business to discuss that couldn't wait."

"What kind of business?"

"Her will."

The word hung in the air between us, heavy with implication. Sterling set down his cup, his movements precise, unhurried.

"Eleanor changed her will frequently," he continued. "At least once a year, sometimes more. She viewed it as a form of control, I suppose. A way to keep the family in line."

"Holding the money over their heads."

"If you want to be crude about it, yes." Sterling's expression remained neutral, but I caught a flicker of distaste. "She would make changes based on their behavior, their choices, whether they pleased or disappointed her. It was exhausting, frankly. But Eleanor paid well for my exhaustion."

"What changes did she want to make last night?"

Sterling hesitated. It was brief. Barely a heartbeat. But I caught it.

"I'm afraid that's protected by attorney-client privilege, Detective."

"Your client is dead, Mr. Sterling."

"The privilege survives death. You know that."

I leaned forward. "A woman was murdered in this house. Poisoned, strangled, and stabbed. That suggests a killer. Or killers. Someone who wanted to make absolutely certain she stayed dead. If those changes to her will gave someone a motive for murder, I need to know."

Sterling stared at me for a long moment, and I watched him wrestle with something behind those careful eyes. Finally, he reached for his briefcase and withdrew a thick manila folder.

"I've already consulted with my partners," he said quietly. "Under the circumstances, we've agreed that cooperating fully with your investigation takes precedence over other considerations. Eleanor would have hated that, by the way. She despised anything that even hinted at impropriety or scandal."

"Then she shouldn't have gotten herself murdered."

Sterling's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile, but close. "No. I suppose not."

He slid the folder across the table. I opened it to find page after page of dense legal text—but something was wrong. Several pages had been torn out, their ragged edges still visible in the binding. Fresh coffee rings stained documents that should have been pristine. And in the margins, someone had scribbled notes in handwriting that wasn't Sterling's neat script.

"What happened to this file?"

Sterling's composure cracked. "Eleanor happened. Last night, after our meeting, she went through everything herself. Tore out the pages she didn't want anyone to see."

I flipped through what remained. Partial sentences jumped out at me: *...beneficiary to be changed upon...* and *...previous arrangement with V. Ashworth hereby terminated...* and most damning of all, a single phrase circled in red ink: *DISINHERIT ENTIRELY.*

"Who was she planning to cut out?"

Sterling didn't answer. Instead, he reached into his briefcase and produced a crumpled ball of paper—something he'd clearly retrieved from Eleanor's wastebasket.

I smoothed it out on the table. A handwritten list in Eleanor's spidery script:

*Victor - NOTHING. He knows why.*
*Julian - everything, held in trust*
*Margot - unchanged*
*D.S. - see attached (VOID)*

"D.S.?" I looked up at Sterling.

His face had gone pale. "My initials."

I noticed his hands were trembling. "She was cutting you out too."

"Look at the bottom of the page, Detective."

I did. Three words, underlined twice: *He knows why.*

"What did Victor do, Mr. Sterling? What did Eleanor discover?"

"If I knew everything, I would tell you." But his eyes slid away from mine, and I noticed a fresh scratch on his right hand—the kind you might get from someone grabbing at you. Fighting back.

"Did she sign this new will?"

Sterling's jaw tightened. "No. We worked on the revisions until nearly midnight, but she wanted to review the final draft in the morning before signing. She was always meticulous about such things."

"So legally, the old will is still in effect."

"Correct. Victor inherits everything. Exactly as he would have if Eleanor had never called me here."

I sat back, my mind churning through the implications. Victor had motive. Eleanor was about to cut him off entirely. But he claimed he didn't know about the will changes. Was that true? Or had Eleanor told him, precipitating a confrontation that ended in murder?

"Did anyone else know about these changes? Anyone in the family?"

Sterling hesitated again. "Eleanor made a phone call while we were working. I only heard her end of the conversation, but she was agitated. Upset in a way I'd rarely seen her."

"Who did she call?"

"I don't know. But she said something that stuck with me." Sterling's brow furrowed as he recalled the memory. "'You should have told me years ago. Do you understand what you've done? What you've taken from this family?'"

The words sent a chill down my spine. I thought of the locket in Eleanor's hand, of Margot's cryptic comments about the past, about my grandmother and the secrets that had haunted my family for two decades.

"What time was this phone call?"

"Around eleven. Maybe eleven-fifteen."

"And you didn't see or hear anything after you went to bed?"

"Nothing. My room is in the west wing, far from the library. I'm a heavy sleeper. Always have been." Sterling's composure finally cracked, and for a moment, he looked old and tired. "I should have stayed with her. Finished the document that night. If I had, perhaps none of this would have happened."

"She'd still be dead," I said flatly. "Whoever did this wasn't going to be stopped by paperwork."

Sterling nodded slowly, but I could see the guilt settling into the lines of his face. It would live there now, alongside whatever other regrets he'd accumulated over thirty-seven years of service to Eleanor Ashworth.

"One more question, Mr. Sterling." I tapped the folder. "You mentioned Eleanor said she'd learned something about Victor recently. Something that made her lose trust in him. Do you have any idea what that might have been?"

"No." But his eyes shifted slightly. I knew he was lying. Or at least not telling me the whole truth.

"If I find out you're withholding information."

"I'm not." He met my gaze, and the steel in his voice was unmistakable. "I've told you everything I know. Everything relevant."

Relevant. A lawyer's word. A way to tell the truth while still keeping secrets.

I gathered the documents and stood. "Don't leave town, Mr. Sterling. I'll have more questions."

"I'm sure you will." He rose as well, straightening his already-perfect tie. "Detective Marlowe, may I offer a word of advice?"

I waited.

"This family has more secrets than a cemetery has bones. The deeper you dig, the more bodies you'll find. Metaphorically speaking." His voice dropped. "Some of those secrets go back decades. Some of them touch people outside this family. People who may not want them exposed."

"Is that a threat, Mr. Sterling?"

"It's a warning." His eyes were grave. "From someone who's seen what happens when Eleanor Ashworth's secrets come to light. Be careful, Detective. The truth in this case may cost more than you're prepared to pay."

I found Julian Ashworth in the kitchen, of all places. It took me another five minutes of navigating the house's maze-like layout—past the butler's pantry, through a service corridor, around a corner I'd already passed twice. The grandson of the family sat hunched over the marble island, a cup of coffee growing cold beside him, steam no longer rising from its surface. His head was in his hands. He was younger than I'd expected. Twenty-two, maybe twenty-three. He had the soft, unfinished look of someone who hadn't yet been fully tempered by life's harder edges.

"Mr. Ashworth?"

He looked up, and I saw red-rimmed eyes, a face pale with shock. Whatever performance the rest of the family was putting on, Julian's grief appeared genuine.

"It's Julian," he said, his voice hoarse. "Please. Mr. Ashworth is my father, and right now, I can't." He broke off, swallowing hard.

I pulled out a stool and sat across from him. The kitchen was enormous, all stainless steel and white marble, the kind of room that had probably never seen Eleanor Ashworth dirty her hands with actual cooking. But it felt more human than the rest of the house, somehow. Less like a mausoleum.

"I know this is difficult," I said. "But I need to ask you some questions about last night."

Julian nodded, wrapping his hands around the cold coffee cup as if seeking warmth. "I already told the other officers. I was in my room all night. Studying for finals. I have contracts and civil procedure next week, and Grandma insisted I come home for the weekend even though I told her I couldn't afford the time."

His voice cracked. I waited.

"She was impossible," Julian continued. "Demanding, controlling, always pushing. She had my whole life planned out. Law school, then the family business, then eventually taking over for my father." He laughed bitterly. "I didn't even want to be a lawyer. I wanted to study marine biology. But Grandma said that was frivolous, that an Ashworth had responsibilities."

"Did you argue about it?"

"All the time. Every time I came home." Julian's jaw tightened. "But I loved her. That's the thing people don't understand about my grandmother. You could hate what she did, hate how she controlled everyone, but she had this presence. This force of will that made you want to please her, even when you knew she was wrong."

"Tell me about dinner last night."

Julian exhaled slowly, gathering his thoughts. "It was tense. It's always tense when the whole family is together, but last night was worse than usual. Grandma and Dad were barely speaking. Mom kept making these sharp little comments. Aunt Margot just sat there, picking at her food like a ghost."

"What were your father and grandmother fighting about?"

"I don't know exactly. But I overheard them arguing in the library before dinner. Something about 'consequences' and 'twenty years of lies.' Dad stormed out, and Grandma just sat there with this look on her face, like she was finally getting everything she wanted."

Twenty years. The number echoed in my head. Twenty years since my grandmother's locket had disappeared. Twenty years since whatever secret had bound this family together had first taken root.

"Did you notice anything else? Anything unusual?"

Julian hesitated. I saw something flicker across his face. Fear, maybe. Or uncertainty.

"Julian?"

"There was a moment during dinner," he said slowly. "Grandma was talking to Mr. Sterling about some business matter. I wasn't really paying attention. And then she stopped mid-sentence. Just froze. She was looking at something on her phone, some message or email. When she looked up, her face was white. Completely white."

"Did she say anything?"

"No. She just excused herself and went to the library. When she came back, she acted like nothing had happened, but I could tell something was wrong. She kept looking at my father with this expression—" Julian shuddered. "Like she was seeing him for the first time. And not liking what she saw."

I made a note to have the tech team pull Eleanor's phone records. Whatever message she'd received had clearly been significant. Possibly the trigger for the phone call Sterling had overheard. Possibly the thing that had made her decide to cut Victor out of her will entirely.

"One more thing, Julian. The locket that was found with your grandmother. Have you ever seen it before?"

He shook his head. "No. I mean, Grandma had lots of jewelry, but I never paid much attention to it. Why? Is it important?"

"Maybe." I stood, tucking my notebook away. "Thank you for your time. I'm sorry for your loss."

Julian caught my arm as I turned to leave. His grip was surprisingly strong.

"Detective Marlowe." His voice was low, urgent. "Everyone in this family has secrets. Things they don't want anyone to know. But I need you to understand something."

I waited.

"Whatever happened to my grandmother, whoever killed her. They're still in this house. I can feel it." His eyes were wide, haunted. "Every time I look at someone. My father, my mother, even Aunt Margot. I think: was it you? Did you do this?"

"That's why I'm here," I said. "To find the truth."

"The truth." Julian laughed, a hollow, desperate sound. "In this family, the truth is just another weapon. Be careful how you use it, Detective. And be careful who you aim it at."

The morning had stretched into afternoon by the time I stepped out onto the back terrace for a cigarette I'd promised myself I'd quit three years ago. The rain had stopped, leaving the world washed clean and smelling of wet earth, but the sky remained gray, heavy with the promise of more storms to come.

I thought about what I'd learned. Victor, on the verge of being disinherited. A sixty-percent fortune slipping through his fingers. Diana, who'd endured years of Eleanor's contempt and had everything to gain from her death. Margot, broken by her mother's cruelty, harboring decades of resentment. Julian, caught in the middle of a family he didn't understand and couldn't escape.

And then there was the locket. My grandmother's locket, clutched in the dead hand of a woman who had apparently "destroyed" its original owner.

I pulled out my phone and dialed Captain Reyes.

"Marlowe. What have you got?"

"Too much and not enough." I lit my cigarette, drawing the smoke deep into my lungs. "The will is a mess. Eleanor was about to disinherit Victor completely. He didn't know, or at least claims he didn't. The attorney says she received some kind of message last night that upset her, triggered a confrontation with Victor. I need her phone records."

"Already working on it. What else?"

"Everyone has motive. Everyone has opportunity. No one has an alibi that holds water." I exhaled, watching the smoke curl away into the gray sky. "And there's something else. Something personal."

Reyes was quiet for a moment. "The locket."

"You saw it?"

"I saw the way you looked at it." Her voice was careful. "Marlowe, if you have a conflict of interest here—"

"I don't."

"James."

The use of my first name stopped me. Maria Reyes and I had worked together for fifteen years. Seen each other through divorces and promotions and cases that left marks neither of us talked about. She knew me better than almost anyone.

"The locket belonged to my grandmother," I said finally. "It disappeared twenty years ago. I haven't seen it since."

"And it turned up in Eleanor Ashworth's hand."

"Yes."

Another pause. I could practically hear her thinking, weighing the options.

"This could be grounds to remove you from the case."

"I know."

"Is that what you want?"

I looked back at the house, at its Gothic towers and darkened windows, at the secrets it held like a crypt holds bones.

"No," I said. "I want answers. I want to know what happened to my grandmother. I want to know why Eleanor Ashworth died holding something that should have been buried with my family's past."

"And if those answers implicate you? Your family?"

"Then they implicate us." I dropped the cigarette, grinding it out beneath my heel. "But I have to know, Maria. After twenty years, I have to know."

Reyes sighed. "You have until tomorrow morning. If you can't maintain objectivity, I'm pulling you off. Understood?"

"Understood."

I hung up and stood there for a long moment, letting the cold air bite at my face. Tomorrow morning. Twenty-four hours to unravel twenty years of secrets.

Behind me, I heard footsteps. Soft. Deliberate. I turned to find Rosa Martinez, the housekeeper, standing in the doorway. She was a small woman, compact and efficient-looking, with gray-streaked hair pulled back in a tight bun and dark eyes that had seen too much.

"Detective Marlowe." Her voice was heavily accented, each word carefully shaped. "You have been talking to everyone. But you have not talked to me."

"I was getting to you, Mrs. Martinez."

"Rosa." She stepped out onto the terrace, pulling her cardigan tight against the chill. "You want to know about the night Mrs. Ashworth died. But I think maybe what you really want to know is about the night her secrets started."

I went very still. "What do you mean?"

Rosa looked at me with those dark, knowing eyes. For a moment, I felt like she could see straight through me. Past the badge and the notebook and the professional detachment. To the scared boy who had stood in this very garden twenty years ago, watching his grandmother cry.

"I have worked for this family for thirty-five years," she said quietly. "I know things, Detective. Things I have never told anyone. Things about the locket. Things about your grandmother."

My heart was pounding. "Tell me."

But Rosa shook her head. "Not here. Not now. Too many ears in this house, too many shadows." She pressed a folded piece of paper into my hand. "Tonight. Midnight. Come alone."

Before I could respond, she turned and disappeared back into the house, leaving me standing on the terrace with a piece of paper burning in my palm and twenty years of questions screaming for answers.

I unfolded the paper with hands that weren't quite steady. A single address, written in careful, precise handwriting, along with simple directions: *Past the garden gate, follow the old cart path for a quarter mile. You'll see the steeple through the trees.*

The old Ashworth chapel. The one that had been abandoned since before I was born. The one where, according to family legend, the first Ashworth had buried his secrets along with his sins.

Tonight, at midnight, I would finally learn the truth.

But as I tucked the paper into my pocket and turned back toward the house, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me. That somewhere in those shadowed windows, a killer was making plans.

And that whatever secrets Rosa Martinez was about to reveal, they would change everything I thought I knew. About the Ashworths. About Eleanor's murder. And about my own family's place in this web of lies.
