# Julian's Confession

I found Julian Ashworth exactly where I expected to find him: in the library, sitting in the same leather chair where his grandmother had died. Getting there had required navigating the house's maze-like corridors—left at the grand staircase, through the music room, past the second-floor gallery—but by now I was learning the layout.

The room had been processed by forensics, the body removed, the bloodstains marked and photographed. Yellow evidence markers still dotted the Persian rug, each one a silent accusation. But Julian sat there anyway, in the predawn darkness, staring at the empty space behind Eleanor's desk as if he could still see her ghost. His hands were wrapped around a glass of whiskey that looked like it hadn't been touched in hours.

He didn't look up when I entered. He simply acknowledged that he had been wondering when I would come for him.

I closed the door behind me and stood in the shadows, watching him. The boy who'd seemed so composed during our first interview. So careful. So measured. Now he looked hollowed out. His shoulders hunched forward like someone carrying a weight too heavy to bear.

The library was exactly the kind of room you'd expect in a house like this—floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, leather-bound volumes that probably hadn't been opened in decades, a massive oak desk positioned to command the entire space. But it was the details that caught my attention. The antique globe on its brass stand, positioned to show the shipping routes the Ashworth family had once dominated. The portrait of Eleanor herself, younger and somehow even more formidable, hanging above the fireplace. The worn spot on the carpet in front of the desk, where generations of supplicants had stood while Eleanor passed judgment on their fates.

I had seen rooms like this before—during the Thornwood investigation, when I'd tracked a string of arsons to an insurance adjustor who operated from a similar study. That case had taught me to look for what wasn't there as much as what was. What was missing in Eleanor's library was any sign of warmth. No family photographs, no personal mementos, nothing to suggest that anyone had ever loved this woman or been loved by her in return. Just cold calculation dressed up as old money.

I asked Julian how he had known I was coming.

He said he didn't know what exactly was going to happen. He didn't know what I knew or what I'd discovered about his father. But he knew something. He'd known from the moment he sat down in this chair that I'd come back for him.

I moved to the window, keeping him in my peripheral vision. Outside, the first gray light of dawn was beginning to touch the gardens. The fountain in the center courtyard caught the light like a mirror, reflecting the sky back at itself. Somewhere in the distance, a bird began to sing—the first tentative notes of morning, oblivious to the darkness inside these walls.

When I asked about his father, Julian finally looked at me. His eyes were red-rimmed, haunted.

He confessed that Victor hadn't killed Eleanor—but he'd wanted to. God, how he'd wanted to. Eleanor had been systematically destroying him for years, stripping away every last vestige of control, dignity, self-respect. Julian could see it happening, could watch his father shrinking a little more every time Eleanor summoned him to this library.

I asked what had changed that particular night.

Julian's hands tightened around his glass. Eleanor had found out something, he said. Something about the family business. Something Victor had been hiding from her for years. Money gone missing. Investments that had failed. Debts that Victor had tried to cover up with creative accounting.

The revelation hit me like a cold wave. Victor had been embezzling from his own family. Eleanor had discovered it. And rather than face her wrath, he'd—

Julian cut off my line of thinking. That was just it, he said. Victor hadn't killed her. He'd gone to confront her, yes. He'd found her in this very room, already dying from the poison someone else had administered. She'd been barely conscious, gasping for air, clawing at her throat as whatever toxin coursed through her veins.

Victor could have saved her. He could have called for help. Instead...

Julian couldn't finish the sentence. He didn't need to. I could picture it clearly enough—Victor Ashworth, standing over his dying mother, watching her suffer, choosing not to intervene. The ultimate act of passive aggression from a man who'd spent his entire life under her thumb.

I pressed further, asking what Victor had done.

Julian described the scene his father had witnessed. Eleanor was already choking, barely conscious, when Victor arrived. And while Victor was standing there, frozen, watching her die—someone else came in. Victor heard footsteps behind him. He turned, and there was Julian himself. His own son. Holding a length of silk cord.

The admission hung in the air like smoke from a fire that had been burning for a long time. I kept my face neutral, my voice steady, and asked Julian to tell me the rest.

He had thought his father was killing her, Julian explained. He'd seen Victor standing over Eleanor, had assumed he'd finally snapped. Julian had come to help—to finish what Victor had started. He described taking the cord, wrapping it around Eleanor's throat, pulling tight while his father watched in frozen horror.

But she was already dying, Julian continued. The poison was working. His strangling—it was just hastening the inevitable. Victor had tried to stop him, pulling Julian off, telling him Eleanor was already dead. But she wasn't. Not yet. She was still breathing, still clinging to life with the same iron will that had defined her entire existence.

I asked what happened next.

Julian's voice had gone flat, mechanical—the voice of someone recounting a nightmare. Eleanor had looked at both of them with what little life remained in her eyes. Then she'd reached for the letter opener on her desk—the same antique blade that had been an Ashworth family heirloom for generations. And with her last remaining strength, she'd driven it into her own heart.

He began to cry. She had killed herself, he said. She'd looked at him, at Victor, and she'd chosen death over the indignity of being murdered by her own family.

The pieces were falling into place now, each one slotting into a framework that made terrible, perfect sense. The poison—administered by someone we hadn't yet identified. The strangulation—Julian's impulsive attempt to help his father. The stabbing—Eleanor's final act of control, choosing the manner of her own death.

I asked why Julian was telling me all of this. He could have stayed silent. Let the investigation go in circles until we either gave up or picked the wrong suspect.

Julian explained that he'd seen how I looked at the locket. The one his grandmother had been clutching when she died. He'd watched my face when the evidence tech had photographed it, had seen something shift in my expression. Something personal. Julian knew that locket meant something to me. That I wasn't going to stop until I had answers. He was tired of secrets—tired of his family's poison seeping into everything it touched.

I moved away from the window, closer to where Julian sat. He tensed slightly but didn't move. This close, I could smell the whiskey on his breath, could see the tremor in his hands.

There was still the matter of who had poisoned Eleanor, I said. If it wasn't Victor, and it wasn't Julian...

Julian looked up at me, and for the first time, I saw something other than grief and guilt in his eyes. I saw fear.

He said he wasn't the only one who came to the library that night. Before his father, before him, there was someone else. He'd heard them arguing with Eleanor earlier in the evening. Heard Eleanor's voice rising in that cold, imperious tone she used when she was about to destroy someone.

I asked who Julian had heard.

Julian's response was quiet, reluctant: Aunt Margot. His father's sister. The one everyone thought was too fragile to hurt anyone. She'd been in the library with Eleanor for nearly an hour before dinner. And when she'd left, her hands were shaking so badly she could barely open the door.

The revelation sent my mind racing. Margot. The broken daughter, the one who'd spent decades under Eleanor's thumb, who'd had her life systematically dismantled by her mother's cruelty. Margot, who knew the household routines, who had access to Eleanor's food and drink, who had been slowly dying inside for so long that perhaps she'd decided to take her mother with her.

I asked if Julian was accusing his aunt of murder.

He said he wasn't accusing anyone. He was just telling me what he knew. What he'd seen and heard. The rest was for me to figure out.

I studied his face, looking for any sign of deception. But all I saw was exhaustion—the kind that comes from carrying too many secrets for too long.

Julian spoke again, almost whispering. There was something else. Something about the locket. His grandmother had told him a story once, when he was young. About a woman who'd been in love with the wrong man. A woman Eleanor had destroyed, years ago, because she'd dared to compete for something Eleanor wanted.

He said he thought that woman might have been my grandmother.

The world seemed to tilt slightly. I gripped the edge of Eleanor's desk, steadying myself.

When I asked what else Eleanor had told him, Julian shook his head. He didn't know the whole story—just pieces, fragments. But he knew it had something to do with why Eleanor had the locket when she died. Why she'd been clutching it so tightly that her fingers had to be pried open.

He said he thought that maybe, in the end, Eleanor had been remembering. Remembering the woman she'd destroyed. The man she'd taken. The life she'd stolen to build her empire.

I stood there in the growing light, processing everything Julian had told me. Three people had wanted Eleanor dead: the poisoner, the strangler, and the victim herself. Each had acted for their own reasons. Each had played a part in the final drama.

But underneath it all, there was something older. A story that went back decades. A woman named Helen—my grandmother—who had loved a man named Marcus Webb. A locket that had traveled from my grandmother's neck to Eleanor's death-grip, carrying secrets across two generations.

I told Julian I would need a formal statement. Everything he'd told me, on the record.

Julian nodded wearily. He expected as much. He asked me to promise him one thing—that if I found out the full truth about his grandmother, about my grandmother, about all of it—I would tell him. He was tired of his family's secrets.

I looked at him—this boy who had tried to kill his grandmother and ended up watching her kill herself. This heir to a dynasty built on blood and lies. And I made a promise I wasn't sure I could keep.

I told him I would try.

The sun was fully up by the time I left the library. The house was stirring now, police officers and forensic techs moving through the corridors, the controlled chaos of an active crime scene. But I barely noticed any of it.

Three suspects. Three methods. And a web of secrets that stretched back further than I'd imagined.

I needed to talk to Margot. Needed to know what had happened in that library before dinner. Needed to understand why a woman who seemed too broken to function had somehow found the strength to poison her own mother.

But first, I needed coffee. And maybe a moment to process the fact that my grandmother's ghost was haunting this case as surely as Eleanor Ashworth's.

I found Captain Reyes in the foyer, directing traffic.

She saw my face and told me I looked like hell.

I felt like it, I told her. I needed to brief her on what I'd learned. It was complicated.

She said it always was. She nodded toward the front door. There was someone outside who wanted to see me. Someone who'd been waiting since before dawn.

I asked who it was.

She said it was someone who claimed to know what really happened to my grandmother. Someone who claimed to have been there when it happened.

My blood ran cold. I asked for a name.

Reyes said the woman called herself Catherine Webb. She said she was Marcus Webb's sister. And she said she was ready to tell me everything.

I walked toward the front door, my heart pounding in my chest. Outside, the morning sun was painting the Ashworth estate in shades of gold and rose, making it look almost beautiful. Almost innocent.

But I knew better now. I knew the darkness that lurked beneath the surface. The bodies buried in the garden. The ghosts that walked these halls.

And I knew, with a certainty that settled into my bones, that whatever Catherine Webb was about to tell me would change everything.

The door swung open. The morning light flooded in.

And I stepped out to meet my past.
