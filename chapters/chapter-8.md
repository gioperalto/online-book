# Julian's Confession

I found Julian Ashworth exactly where I expected to find him: in the library, sitting in the same leather chair where his grandmother had died.

The room had been processed by forensics, the body removed, the bloodstains marked and photographed. But Julian sat there anyway, in the predawn darkness, staring at the empty space behind Eleanor's desk as if he could still see her ghost. His hands were wrapped around a glass of whiskey that looked like it hadn't been touched in hours.

"Detective." He didn't look up when I entered. "I was wondering when you'd come for me."

I closed the door behind me and stood in the shadows, watching him. The boy who'd seemed so composed during our first interview. So careful. So measured. Now he looked hollowed out. His shoulders hunched forward like someone carrying a weight too heavy to bear.

"You know why I'm here."

"Because of what Margot saw." Julian finally looked at me, and I saw something in his eyes I hadn't expected: relief. "She told you, didn't she? About finding grandmother already dying. About seeing someone strangling her."

"She described the attacker. Tall. Broad shoulders. Someone young and quick." I stepped closer, my hand resting near my weapon out of habit. "That description fits you, Julian."

A sound escaped him. Something between a laugh and a sob. "It does. It absolutely does." He set the whiskey glass down on the side table with exaggerated care. "I wondered how long it would take for someone to put it together. Part of me hoped it would take longer. Part of me wanted to be caught the moment I left this room that night."

"So you admit it. You tried to strangle Eleanor Ashworth."

"Yes." The word came out flat, exhausted. "I put my hands around my grandmother's throat and I squeezed. I felt her pulse under my fingers. I watched her eyes flutter." Julian's hands were shaking now, pressed flat against his thighs. "And then I stopped."

I didn't move. Didn't speak. I let the silence stretch between us, giving him space to fill it.

"I didn't know about the poison," he continued. "When I went to her that night, I thought she was drunk. She was slurring her words, couldn't focus, kept drifting in and out. I thought." He broke off, shaking his head. "It doesn't matter what I thought. What matters is what I did."

"Why did you stop?"

Julian was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice was barely above a whisper.

"Because she looked at me. In that moment, with my hands around her throat, she actually saw me for the first time in my life. Not as an heir, not as a chess piece in her games, not as another Ashworth to be molded and controlled. She saw me as a person." He wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand. "And she said my name. Just my name, nothing else. But the way she said it—"

"What way?"

"Like she was saying goodbye. Like she knew she deserved what was happening and she was accepting it." Julian's voice cracked. "I couldn't do it. I couldn't be the one to end her, not like that. So I ran. I went through the garden door and I ran back to my room and I told myself I would pretend it never happened."

I pulled a chair across from him and sat down, studying his face in the dim light. The morning was starting to gray the windows now, the first hints of dawn bleeding through the curtains.

"You need to understand something, Julian. The medical examiner determined that strangulation wasn't what killed Eleanor. She was poisoned first. A slow-acting toxin that was already shutting down her systems by the time you got to her. And the actual cause of death was the letter opener wound to her chest."

Julian stared at me. "The letter opener?"

"Self-inflicted. The angle of entry. The hesitation marks. Your grandmother stabbed herself with her own letter opener after you fled."

"She—" Julian's face went pale. "She killed herself?"

"It appears so. We think she chose to end it on her own terms rather than let the poison finish her." I leaned forward. "Which means you're not a murderer, Julian. You're an attempted murderer, and there's a significant legal distinction. But I need to understand why. Why did you go to that library with the intention of killing your grandmother?"

The silence stretched. Julian's eyes were fixed on some middle distance, seeing something I couldn't.

"Do you know what it's like to grow up in this house, Detective? To be raised by someone who sees you as an investment rather than a person?" His voice had gone hard, bitter. "My grandmother controlled everything. What I wore, what I studied, who I could be friends with. She decided I would be a lawyer. Not because I had any interest in law. Because the family needed a lawyer. She mapped out my entire life before I was old enough to have an opinion about it."

"You wanted to study marine biology."

"I wanted to study anything that would get me out of this prison." Julian laughed, hollow and sharp. "But grandmother threatened to cut off my tuition if I changed majors. Threatened to cut off my trust fund. Threatened to make sure no school in the country would accept me." He shook his head. "She had that kind of power. That kind of reach. And she used it without hesitation."

"That's not a reason to kill someone."

"No. It's not." Julian met my eyes, and I saw something new there. A deeper pain. Older and rawer than resentment over a college major. "But what she did to my father is."

I went very still. "What did she do to your father?"

"My father has been stealing from the family. You know that. He confessed to it. What you don't know is why." Julian's hands clenched into fists. "My father isn't a thief by nature, Detective. He's weak, yes. Spineless. A disappointment to the Ashworth name, according to grandmother. But he's not evil."

"Then why embezzle two hundred thousand dollars?"

"Because he was paying off a debt. A debt that grandmother created." Julian stood abruptly, pacing to the window and staring out at the lightening sky. "Twenty years ago, my father fell in love with someone. Someone grandmother didn't approve of. A woman from the wrong family. The wrong social class. The wrong everything. So grandmother did what she always did when someone threatened her control: she destroyed them."

"How?"

"The same way she destroyed your grandmother and Marcus Webb. Lies, manipulation, threats. She told my father's lover that he was already engaged to someone else. To my mother. She paid people to spread rumors about the woman's family. She had her father fired from his job and her brother arrested on fabricated charges." Julian's voice shook with barely contained rage. "And when all of that wasn't enough, she paid the woman herself. Offered her a fortune to disappear and never contact my father again."

I thought about Margot, about the man Eleanor had paid off to break her daughter's heart. The pattern was the same. Eleanor wielded love like a weapon, destroying anyone who dared to form connections outside her control.

"The woman took the money?"

"She didn't have a choice. Grandmother made it clear that if she refused, things would get worse for her family. Much worse." Julian turned to face me. "So she vanished. And my father married my mother six months later. An Ashworth-approved match. An Ashworth-approved bride. An Ashworth-approved future. He's been miserable ever since."

"And the embezzlement?"

"The woman came back. Three years ago. She'd fallen on hard times, needed money, remembered the rich man who'd once loved her." Julian's smile was grim. "She started blackmailing my father. Threatening to tell my mother, to expose the whole sordid history, unless he paid her. And my father, being the coward he is, started stealing from the family accounts rather than face the truth."

"Eleanor found out."

"Last week. She went through the financial records and discovered the discrepancies. Confronted my father at dinner, in front of everyone. That's what the argument was about. Not just the theft. The reason behind it. Grandmother realized her old crime was coming back to haunt her, and she blamed my father for being too weak to handle it himself."

I processed this information, fitting it into the larger picture. Victor's embezzlement wasn't just greed. It was desperation. A man trapped between his mother's control and the consequences of her decades-old cruelty.

"So you decided to avenge your father."

"I decided to end the cycle." Julian's voice was fierce now, burning with conviction. "Grandmother was going to disinherit my father. Fine. She was going to give everything to me. Fine. But she was also going to destroy that woman. The one my father loved. The same way she'd destroyed everyone else who crossed her. I heard her making calls that night, giving orders, setting things in motion. And I knew—" He trailed off, his jaw tight.

"You knew she would never stop."

"She would never stop. As long as she was alive, she would keep hurting people. Keep manipulating, controlling, destroying. And I thought." His voice broke. "I thought if I could end it, if I could stop her before she ruined another life, maybe it would be worth it. Maybe the guilt would be worth it."

"But you couldn't go through with it."

"No." Julian sank back into the chair, all the fight draining out of him. "I'm not a killer, Detective. I thought I could be, for one moment. But when it mattered, I was just as weak as my father."

I sat there in the gray morning light, looking at this young man who had tried to commit murder and failed. He wasn't innocent. He'd had his hands around his grandmother's throat. Had felt her life pulsing beneath his fingers. But he also wasn't the one who'd killed her. The poison had come first, administered by someone else. And Eleanor had ultimately chosen her own end.

"Julian, I need you to think carefully. When you were in this room with Eleanor, did you see or hear anything unusual? Anyone else in the house moving around?"

He frowned, concentrating. "I heard footsteps in the hallway before I went in. Someone walking quickly, trying to be quiet. I assumed it was one of the staff."

"Did you see who it was?"

"No. By the time I looked, they were gone." He paused. "But when I was leaving. When I ran through the garden door. I thought I saw someone on the lawn. A shadow, moving toward the old chapel."

I sat up straighter. "What time was this?"

"Maybe ten minutes after midnight. I wasn't watching the clock, but it couldn't have been much later."

A shadow moving toward the chapel at midnight. The same chapel where Rosa and I had been attacked, where Margot had hidden her burner phone, where decades of secrets had been building toward this moment.

"Detective?" Julian's voice pulled me back. "What's going to happen to me?"

I looked at him. This young man who had wanted to be a marine biologist. Who had tried to kill his grandmother and failed. Who was now facing the consequences of that choice.

"You're going to tell Captain Reyes exactly what you told me. Every detail, every word. You'll need a lawyer. A good one. You'll probably face charges for attempted murder, assault, maybe more depending on what the DA decides." I paused. "But you came forward. You cooperated. That counts for something."

"And my father?"

"That's between your father and the law." I stood, stretching muscles that had gone stiff from too many hours without sleep. "But Julian. The woman who's been blackmailing him. What's her name?"

Julian hesitated, and I saw the conflict in his face. Loyalty to his father warring with the need to tell the truth.

"Sarah," he said finally. "Sarah Marlowe. She's your ex-wife, Detective. I thought you knew."

---

The world tilted.

I stood in Eleanor Ashworth's library, the dawn light turning everything gold and rose, and felt the ground shift beneath my feet.

Sarah. My Sarah. The woman I'd married and divorced and hadn't spoken to in three years. The woman whose photograph I still kept face-down on my kitchen table. The woman I'd been about to call when this whole case began.

Sarah was the one Victor had been paying off. Sarah had been blackmailing him for years. Sarah was connected to this family in ways I had never imagined.

"Detective?" Julian's voice seemed to come from very far away. "Are you all right?"

"You're sure." My voice sounded strange in my own ears. "You're sure it was Sarah Marlowe."

"I saw the checks my father wrote. I did my own research after I found out about the embezzlement." Julian's expression shifted to something like pity. "I'm sorry. I assumed you knew. I thought that was why you were on this case. Why you had that personal connection to our family."

I thought about the photograph on my kitchen table. Sarah had taken that picture. She'd been the one to find it in my grandmother's things after she died, to frame it, to place it where I could see it every day. At the time, I'd thought it was a kindness. A way of connecting me to a past I'd been trying to understand.

Now I saw it differently.

Sarah had known. She'd known about my grandmother and the Ashworths for years. Maybe since before we even met. Our entire marriage, our entire relationship, had been built on a secret she'd never told me.

"I need to make a call." I moved toward the door, my legs feeling like they belonged to someone else. "Stay here. Don't leave the house. Captain Reyes will be here within the hour."

"Detective."

I didn't hear what else Julian said. I was already in the hallway, already pulling out my phone, already dialing a number I hadn't called in three years.

It rang twice. Three times.

Then: "James?"

Sarah's voice, thick with sleep, with surprise, with something else I couldn't identify.

"We need to talk." My voice was steady. Professional. The voice of a detective, not an ex-husband. "About Victor Ashworth. About the money. About everything you never told me."

A long silence. When she spoke again, all the sleep was gone from her voice.

"I wondered when you'd find out. I thought it would be sooner, honestly." A pause. "I'm already in Millbrook, James. I arrived yesterday. The Ashworth case is all over the news, and I thought—" Another pause, longer this time. "I thought you might need someone to talk to."

"Where are you?"

"The motel on Route 7. Room 14." Her laugh was bitter, self-mocking. "I've been sitting here for sixteen hours, trying to work up the courage to call you. I guess I don't have to now."

"Stay there. I'm coming to you."

"James. There are things you need to understand. Things about your grandmother. About the Ashworths. About why I."

"I know about the blackmail, Sarah. I know about Victor's payments. What I don't know is why you never told me any of this. Why you let me believe our marriage ended because of the job, because of my distance, because of all the things I blamed myself for." My voice cracked, just slightly. "You owed me the truth."

"I know." Her voice was barely a whisper. "I know I did. And I was going to tell you. So many times, I was going to tell you. But then your grandmother died, and you were so broken, and I thought—" She trailed off.

"You thought what?"

"I thought telling you would destroy you. That learning the truth about your family. About what Eleanor Ashworth did to them, and what I'd done to survive it. It would break something in you that couldn't be fixed." Sarah took a shaky breath. "I was trying to protect you, James. I know that doesn't excuse anything. But I need you to understand. I loved you. That part was never a lie."

I stood in the hallway of the Ashworth mansion, phone pressed to my ear, and felt the weight of three years of silence pressing down on me. Three years of unanswered questions. Three years of blame and guilt and lonely nights wondering what I'd done wrong.

"I'm coming to the motel," I said finally. "We're going to talk. All of it, Sarah. Everything you know, everything you did, everything you should have told me years ago."

"Okay." Her voice was small, fragile. "James? I'm glad you called. Whatever happens next, I'm glad you finally called."

I hung up without responding. Then I stood there in the hallway, watching the morning light creep through the tall windows, and tried to make sense of a world that had just turned inside out.

My ex-wife was connected to Eleanor Ashworth's crimes.

Julian had tried to strangle his grandmother and failed.

Someone had poisoned Eleanor before Julian ever entered that room.

And somewhere in this house, the real killer was still walking free. The one who had started all of this.

---

I found Reyes in the driveway, coordinating the search for the burner phone that Margot had already given me. She looked tired, professionally rumpled, but her eyes sharpened when she saw my face.

"What happened?"

"Julian confessed to the strangulation attempt. He's in the library. We'll need to bring him in for formal questioning and probably arrest him." I handed her the burner phone I'd been carrying since Margot gave it to me at the chapel. "This is Margot's. She was the informant feeding information to Catherine Webb."

Reyes took the phone, turning it over in her hands. "So we've got our strangler. What about the poisoner?"

"Still unknown. Julian didn't administer the poison. He thought Eleanor was drunk when he found her. The poison was already in her system by then." I paused, weighing how much to tell her. "There's something else. Sarah. My ex-wife. She's connected to this case."

Reyes's eyebrows rose. "Connected how?"

"She's been blackmailing Victor Ashworth for years. That's why he was embezzling. To pay her off." The words felt like broken glass in my mouth. "She's in town. I'm going to interview her."

"Marlowe." Reyes caught my arm as I moved toward my car. "Are you sure you should be the one doing that? Given your history."

"My history is exactly why I need to do it." I met her eyes. "Sarah knows things about this family. Things that might explain who poisoned Eleanor. I need to hear it from her."

Reyes studied me for a long moment. Then she nodded, releasing my arm.

"Keep me informed. And Marlowe? Don't do anything stupid."

"Too late for that," I said. "I took this case."

I got in my car and drove toward Route 7, toward the motel where my ex-wife was waiting, toward answers I was no longer sure I wanted.

The sun was fully up now, painting Millbrook in shades of gold and shadow. Somewhere behind me, the Ashworth mansion stood silent, holding on to its last secrets. And ahead of me, Sarah waited with the truth I'd been running from for three years.

BUT the truth, I was beginning to learn, had a way of finding you whether you were ready for it or not.

THEREFORE, I kept driving.
