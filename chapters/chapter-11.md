# Standing Among Stones

The cemetery sat on a hill overlooking Millbrook, ancient oaks casting long shadows across rows of weathered headstones. I'd been here before—for my grandmother's funeral, for the handful of times I'd forced myself to visit afterward. But the drive had never felt this heavy. Each mile was a weight settling into my chest.

My father's pickup truck was parked near the old section, rusted at the wheel wells and faded to a color that had once been blue. I pulled in beside it and sat for a moment, watching the solitary figure standing among the graves.

Robert Marlowe was sixty-seven years old. Tall once, before the years had bent him forward. Gray hair cropped short, flannel shirt tucked into work pants, hands shoved deep in his pockets. He didn't turn when I approached, just kept staring at the simple granite marker that bore my grandmother's name.

HELEN MARIE MARLOWE
1932-2021
BELOVED MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER

"You used to bring her flowers," I said, stopping beside him. "Yellow roses. Her favorite."

"Still do." He nodded toward a small bouquet leaning against the headstone, the petals already wilting in the afternoon heat. "Some things you don't stop doing just because they don't make sense anymore."

We stood in silence. The wind moved through the oaks, carrying the smell of cut grass and turned earth. Somewhere in the distance, a lawn mower droned.

"You called Eleanor Ashworth the day she died."

"I did."

"You told her you were Marcus Webb's son. You threatened to expose her."

"I did that too." My father finally turned to look at me. His eyes were red-rimmed, but dry. "Took me forty years to work up the courage. Forty years of knowing what that woman did, what she took from this family, and being too goddamn scared to do anything about it."

"How long have you known?"

"About Marcus? About who I really am?" He laughed, bitter and short. "I found out when I was seventeen. Your grandmother—" He paused, swallowed hard. "She told me the night before my high school graduation. Said I deserved to know the truth before I went out into the world."

I tried to imagine it. Seventeen years old, on the cusp of adulthood, learning that everything you believed about your family was built on lies. Learning that your father wasn't your father. That your mother had been forced into a marriage she never wanted, carrying another man's child.

"She told you about Eleanor."

"She told me everything." My father's voice was rough, scraped raw. "About Marcus Webb—my real father. About how they fell in love working at the Ashworth shipping company. About how Eleanor wanted Marcus for herself and couldn't stand that he chose your grandmother instead." He shook his head slowly. "She told me about the lies Eleanor spread, the marriage she forced, the transfer to Seattle that was really an exile. And she told me that Marcus died in a shipping accident three years later—an accident that wasn't an accident at all."

"Eleanor had him killed."

"Eleanor had everyone killed. Anyone who got in her way, anyone who knew too much, anyone who threatened her perfect little empire." My father's hands were trembling now. "And your grandmother lived with that knowledge for sixty years, James. Sixty years of knowing the man she loved had been murdered, that she'd been forced to marry someone else, that her son was the only piece of Marcus she had left. Sixty years of silence because she knew if she spoke up, Eleanor would destroy her too."

I thought about the photograph I kept face-down on my kitchen table. My grandmother with my father as a teenager, both of them smiling, the Ashworth mansion visible in the background. A moment of happiness captured against the backdrop of so much pain.

"When did you connect with Catherine Webb?"

"About five years ago." My father moved to a nearby bench and sat heavily, like the weight of the conversation was too much to bear standing. "I'd been gathering information for years—newspaper clippings, public records, anything I could find about Marcus Webb's death. But I hit walls everywhere I turned. The Ashworths owned this town, James. They controlled the police, the courts, the newspapers. Every trail I followed led to a dead end."

I sat beside him, maintaining the distance I'd kept my whole adult life. The space between us felt like a canyon.

"Then I found Catherine. Marcus's sister. She'd been doing the same thing I was—collecting evidence, building a case, waiting for the right moment." He smiled grimly. "Turns out I wasn't the only one who'd spent decades nursing a grudge against Eleanor Ashworth."

"Catherine mentioned an informant inside the Ashworth house. Someone feeding her information."

"Margot Ashworth." My father nodded. "We never knew her name until recently, but she'd been reaching out to Catherine for months. Sending documents, photographs, financial records. She hated her mother almost as much as we did."

"Why now? After all these years, why did you call Eleanor the day she died?"

My father was quiet for a long moment. The lawn mower had stopped, leaving only the wind and the distant sound of traffic from the highway below.

"Because your grandmother asked me to."

The words landed like a physical blow. I turned to stare at him.

"Before she died," he continued, his voice barely above a whisper, "your grandmother made me promise. She said she'd spent her whole life being afraid of Eleanor Ashworth, letting that fear control her, letting it steal the justice Marcus deserved. She said she didn't want to die knowing that fear had won." He met my eyes, and I saw tears forming. "She made me promise that after she was gone, I would find a way to make Eleanor pay. Not through violence—she was clear about that. Through exposure. Through the truth. Through the world finally knowing what Eleanor Ashworth had done."

"So you called Eleanor."

"I told her I had proof. That Catherine and I had spent years building a case—documents showing the payments she'd made to cover up Marcus's murder, records of other people she'd destroyed, evidence that would end the Ashworth name forever." My father's hands clenched into fists. "I told her that if she didn't meet with me, I would take everything to the press. That her legacy would be ashes and disgrace."

"And Eleanor panicked."

"I've never heard someone so afraid." There was no satisfaction in his voice—only exhaustion. "She who had controlled everything, destroyed everyone, spent her whole life as the puppet master—and suddenly she was the one dangling from strings. She begged me to wait, to give her time, to let her 'handle things.' I told her she had until noon the next day."

"But she didn't make it to noon."

"No." My father slumped forward, head in his hands. "I didn't know what was happening in that house, James. I didn't know about Diana's poison or Julian's hands or any of it. I just thought I was finally confronting the woman who'd stolen everything from my family. I didn't know I was lighting a fuse that would blow the whole thing apart."

I sat with that, letting it settle. My father hadn't killed Eleanor Ashworth. He hadn't even been in Millbrook when she died. But his phone call had been the spark—the catalyst that sent Diana to her conservatory for poison, that pushed Julian past his breaking point, that made Eleanor so afraid she lost control of everything she'd spent a lifetime building.

"The documents you mentioned," I said. "The evidence you and Catherine gathered. Where is it now?"

"Catherine has most of it. Bank records, correspondence, a detailed timeline of Marcus's last months." My father straightened, reaching into his jacket pocket. "But I have something she doesn't."

He pulled out a small leather pouch, worn soft with age. Inside was a folded piece of paper, yellowed at the edges.

"Your grandmother kept a letter. The last letter Marcus ever wrote to her, sent from Seattle two days before he died." My father handed it to me. "She never showed it to anyone. Kept it hidden her whole life. But before she passed, she gave it to me and said it was time for someone else to carry it."

I unfolded the paper carefully, handling it like the artifact it was. The handwriting was faded but legible—neat, precise strokes from a man who had taken care with his words.

*My dearest Helen,*

*I know now that I will not survive this. Eleanor's reach extends even here, and I have seen the way her people watch me. They think I don't notice, but I do. I notice everything now.*

*I want you to know that I do not regret loving you. Not for a moment. Whatever she told your husband, whatever lies she spread to tear us apart—the truth is that you were the best thing that ever happened to me. Our child will be born soon, and though I may never meet them, I need you to know: I would do it all again. Every stolen moment, every whispered promise, every risk we took. You were worth it. They will be worth it.*

*Eleanor believes she can erase me. She believes that if I disappear, the truth dies with me. But she's wrong. The truth never dies, Helen. It waits. It finds a way.*

*If something happens to me, take care of yourself and our child. Don't try to fight her—not yet. She's too powerful, too connected, too willing to destroy anyone in her path. But keep the records I left with Catherine. One day, when the time is right, the world will know what Eleanor Ashworth really is.*

*I love you. I have always loved you. And nothing—not distance, not lies, not even death—can change that.*

*Forever yours,*
*Marcus*

I read it twice, three times, letting the words burn into my memory. This was my grandfather's voice. Not the man whose name I'd carried, whose genes I'd assumed were mine—but my real grandfather, writing to the woman he loved while death closed in around him.

"He knew," I said quietly. "He knew Eleanor was going to have him killed."

"He knew. And he sent that letter anyway, knowing it might be the last thing he ever wrote." My father's voice cracked. "Your grandmother carried that weight alone for sixty years, James. Knowing the truth, having proof, but being too afraid to use it. Can you imagine? Living your whole life with that secret burning inside you?"

I thought about Sarah. About the secrets she'd carried through our marriage, the truths she'd hidden to protect both of us. I thought about Diana, enduring twenty years in Eleanor's house while plotting her revenge. About Margot, gathering evidence in silence, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Everyone in Eleanor Ashworth's orbit had been keeping secrets. Everyone had been carrying weights too heavy to bear alone.

"What happens now?" I asked. "The evidence you and Catherine gathered—what are you planning to do with it?"

"That depends on you." My father turned to face me fully for the first time since I'd arrived. "Eleanor's dead, James. The woman who destroyed our family is gone. Part of me wants to burn it all, move on, let the past stay buried."

"But?"

"But that's not what your grandmother wanted. She wanted the truth exposed. She wanted the world to know what kind of monster Eleanor really was." He paused. "And there's something else. Something Catherine discovered in her investigation that changes everything."

"What?"

"Eleanor wasn't acting alone. All those years, all those crimes—she had help. A network of people who enabled her, covered for her, benefited from her power." My father's eyes were hard. "Some of them are still alive. Still in positions of influence in this town. If we go public with what we know, it won't just be Eleanor's legacy that burns. It'll be the whole corrupt system she built."

I thought about David Sterling, the attorney who had admitted to decades of complicity. About the mayor and police chief who Rosa claimed owed Eleanor everything. About the web of favors and threats and buried secrets that had allowed one woman to control an entire community.

"You're talking about bringing down half of Millbrook."

"I'm talking about justice." My father's voice was fierce now, a fire kindling in his eyes that I'd never seen before. "Sixty years of looking the other way, of letting the Ashworths do whatever they wanted because they had money and power. Your grandmother lived and died under that system, James. Marcus was murdered by it. How many others? How many people crushed because Eleanor could afford to crush them?"

"And you want me to help."

"You're the detective on the case. You have access to evidence, to witnesses, to the official investigation." He reached out, gripping my arm—the first time he'd touched me in years. "This isn't about revenge anymore, son. It's about finally doing what's right. What your grandmother asked for. What Marcus died hoping would happen."

I pulled away gently, standing and walking to my grandmother's headstone. The yellow roses trembled in the breeze.

"I need time to think."

"I understand."

"The case isn't closed. Diana and Julian will face charges. There are still questions about how everything unfolded that night, about who knew what and when." I turned back to face him. "If I start pulling on threads that lead outside the Ashworth family, it could complicate everything. Prosecutions could fall apart. Guilty people could walk free."

"Or it could expose the whole rotten system that protected Eleanor for decades." My father stood, joining me at the grave. "I'm not asking you to compromise your investigation, James. I'm asking you to follow the evidence wherever it leads—even if it leads places you don't expect."

We stood there in silence, father and son, divided by years of distance and silence and things unsaid. The grave between us bore my grandmother's name, but she was no longer the only presence here. Marcus Webb was with us too, his ghost finally acknowledged after sixty years of erasure.

"There's something I need to tell you," I said finally. "About Sarah."

My father's expression shifted. "Your ex-wife?"

"She's in town. She was involved with Victor Ashworth years ago, before I ever met her. Eleanor destroyed her family, paid her off, drove her away." I took a breath. "She's been blackmailing Victor for three years. Using the money to survive after everything Eleanor took from her."

My father absorbed this in silence. Then: "Does she know about us? About our connection to the Ashworths?"

"She found out after we were married. Found grandmother's papers, her letters, figured out the connection." I shook my head. "She kept it from me. Said she was trying to protect me from Eleanor's reach."

"Do you believe her?"

The question hung in the air. Did I believe Sarah? Did I trust that her lies had been born from love rather than self-preservation?

"I don't know what I believe anymore," I admitted. "This whole case—every layer I peel back, there's another secret underneath. Everyone in Eleanor's orbit has been hiding something. Everyone has reasons, justifications, excuses for the lies they told."

"That's what happens when you build a world on fear." My father's voice was quiet, reflective. "Eleanor made people afraid to tell the truth. So they lied to survive, and the lies became habit, and eventually nobody could tell the difference between who they really were and who they'd become to protect themselves."

I thought about myself. About the distance I'd maintained from my family, the walls I'd built, the way I'd avoided questions about my past because the answers were too complicated to explain. Had I been protecting myself? Or had I been running from a truth I wasn't ready to face?

"I should go," I said. "Diana's arrest is going to require paperwork. Statements. Reyes will be waiting."

"I'll be here." My father looked at my grandmother's headstone. "Got nowhere else to be."

I turned to leave, then stopped. "Dad?"

The word felt strange in my mouth. I couldn't remember the last time I'd used it.

"Yeah?"

"The letter from Marcus. Can I keep it?"

A pause. Then my father reached into his pocket and pressed the leather pouch into my hand.

"It should have been yours all along," he said. "You're his great-grandson. His blood. Whatever you decide to do with what we've found, whatever path you choose—you have more right to it than anyone."

I tucked the pouch into my jacket, feeling the weight of it against my chest. Sixty years of secrets, compressed into a few folded pages.

"I'll call you," I said. "After I figure out what to do."

"Take your time." My father's hand brushed my shoulder—a gesture so unfamiliar it made me flinch. "I've been waiting forty years. A few more days won't kill me."

I walked back to my car, leaving my father standing among the graves. As I pulled out of the cemetery, I could see him in my rearview mirror—a solitary figure growing smaller, keeping vigil over the woman who had loved Marcus Webb and paid for it with her whole life.

---

The drive back to Millbrook took twenty minutes. I used every second of it, turning over everything I'd learned.

My father's phone call had been the catalyst. Diana's poison had been the weapon. Julian's hands had been the violence. And Eleanor herself had wielded the final blow, refusing to let anyone else control her ending.

But underneath all of that was something older. A sixty-year-old murder, covered up and buried. A love story destroyed by jealousy and power. A family legacy built on blood and lies.

Eleanor Ashworth was dead. Her killers—if you could call them that—were identified. The case, by any traditional measure, was closed.

Yet the truth Marcus Webb had died for was still waiting to be told. And the system that had protected Eleanor, that had allowed her crimes to flourish unchecked for decades, was still in place.

As I drove toward the station to file my reports and close out the official investigation, I found myself thinking not about the end—instead about what came next.

The dead were finally speaking. And I owed it to all of them to make sure the living heard.
