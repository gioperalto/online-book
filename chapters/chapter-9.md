# The Ex-Wife's Truth

The Route 7 Motel sat at the edge of Millbrook like an afterthought—a strip of faded stucco rooms with a gravel parking lot and a neon sign that buzzed VACANCY in letters the color of dried blood. I pulled into the lot and sat in my car for a long moment, watching the door marked 14.

Sixteen hours. Sarah had been in this town for sixteen hours, waiting to see if I would call. Waiting to see if the truth would finally catch up with both of us.

I thought about the last time I'd seen her. The divorce papers spread across our kitchen table. The silence that had grown between us like a wall, brick by brick, until neither of us could see over it anymore. I'd blamed the job, the long hours, the dead bodies that followed me home in my dreams. She'd blamed my distance, my inability to let anyone close enough to matter.

Neither of us had blamed the real culprit: the secrets she'd been carrying since before we'd ever met.

I got out of the car and walked to Room 14. My knuckles hovered over the door for three heartbeats before I knocked.

The door opened immediately. Sarah had been waiting on the other side.

She looked the same. Different. Both at once. The same dark hair I remembered, now shot through with early gray at the temples. The same sharp cheekbones, the same careful posture. But there were new lines around her eyes, new shadows beneath them. Three years had changed her in ways I couldn't quite name.

"James." My name in her mouth still sounded like a question.

"Sarah."

She stepped aside, and I entered the room. It was exactly what you'd expect from a motel on Route 7—a double bed with a cigarette burn on the comforter, a television bolted to the dresser, a window unit air conditioner that rattled like a dying animal. Sarah had clearly been here for hours: takeout containers on the nightstand, her laptop open on the bed, a half-empty bottle of wine breathing on the desk.

"You want something to drink?" She closed the door behind me. "I have wine. Or I could make coffee. The machine is terrible, but—"

"I don't want wine." I turned to face her. "I want answers."

Sarah nodded slowly, like she'd expected this. Like she'd been rehearsing for this moment. She sat on the edge of the bed and folded her hands in her lap—a gesture I recognized from our marriage. She did it when she was bracing for impact.

"Where do you want me to start?"

"At the beginning." I pulled out the desk chair and sat across from her, keeping the distance professional. "When did you first meet Victor Ashworth?"

A pause. Then: "Twenty-three years ago. I was twenty-two, fresh out of college, working as a receptionist at a law firm downtown. Victor was a client—young, handsome, heir to one of the oldest fortunes in Millbrook." Her smile was bitter, self-mocking. "I thought I'd won the lottery."

"You fell in love with him."

"I fell in love with a version of him. The version he showed me—kind, gentle, desperate to escape his mother's shadow." Sarah's eyes went distant, remembering. "We were together for eight months. He talked about marriage, about running away together, about starting over somewhere Eleanor couldn't reach us. I believed him."

"What happened?"

"Eleanor happened." The name came out like a curse. "She found out about us. Victor had been careful—secret meetings, borrowed phones, cash payments for everything—but Eleanor had eyes everywhere. She probably knew from the beginning and just waited until it was most convenient to strike."

I thought about the pattern. Margot's lost love, paid off and disappeared. Marcus Webb, destroyed for daring to love Marlowe's grandmother. Eleanor wielded love like a weapon, cutting down anyone who threatened her control.

"She threatened you."

"She destroyed me." Sarah's voice was flat, matter-of-fact. "First, she had my father fired. He'd worked at the same factory for twenty years—foreman, perfect record, beloved by his crew. One day, out of nowhere, they accused him of safety violations he never committed. They showed him falsified reports, doctored records, evidence that appeared out of thin air. He was escorted off the property by security."

"Eleanor manufactured the evidence."

"She manufactured everything. When my father's termination wasn't enough to make me leave Victor, she went after my brother. Planted drugs in his car, tipped off the police. He spent six months in county jail before they dropped the charges—not because they believed he was innocent, but because Eleanor decided she'd made her point." Sarah's hands were shaking now, her composure cracking at the edges. "And then she came to me personally."

"What did she offer?"

"One hundred thousand dollars to disappear. To never contact Victor again, never return to Millbrook, never speak about what had happened." Sarah laughed, hollow and sharp. "And she made it very clear what would happen if I refused. My father would never work again. My brother would go to prison for real next time. My mother's medical bills would somehow stop being covered by insurance. Eleanor was thorough, James. She didn't just threaten—she demonstrated."

I sat in the plastic chair, processing. This was the Sarah I'd married—the woman I'd thought I knew—carrying this weight alone for over two decades. Living with the knowledge of what she'd been forced to sacrifice, what she'd lost.

"So you took the money."

"I took the money. I moved to Detroit. I changed my name—my professional name, anyway—and I started over." Sarah's eyes met mine. "I tried to forget Victor, to forget Millbrook, to forget everything Eleanor had done. And for a while, it worked."

"Until it didn't."

"Until the money ran out and I got desperate." She stood abruptly, pacing to the window and staring out at the gravel parking lot. "The hundred thousand sounds like a lot, but it doesn't last forever. My father was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. My brother needed rehab after his time in jail broke something in him. My mother needed care my paycheck couldn't cover. And every time I thought about where I was, how I'd gotten there, I thought about Victor. About the fortune he'd inherited. About the life I should have had."

"So you started blackmailing him."

"I didn't think of it as blackmail." She turned to face me, and I saw something fierce in her eyes—defiant, unapologetic. "I thought of it as recovery. Eleanor had stolen my future. Victor had been too weak to fight for me. The least they owed me was enough money to survive."

"You've been taking payments from Victor for three years."

"Small amounts at first. Enough to cover my mother's care, my brother's treatment. Victor was terrified that Diana would find out, that Eleanor would discover his weakness. He paid without question." Sarah's voice hardened. "And then, six months ago, I found out about the embezzlement. Victor wasn't paying me from his own accounts—he was stealing from the family to keep me quiet. Which meant Eleanor would eventually notice."

"She noticed last week."

"I know. Victor called me, panicking. Said Eleanor had discovered everything, was going to cut him off entirely, was already making calls to people who could 'handle problems.'" Sarah shook her head. "I told him to come clean. To tell Diana, tell the lawyers, get ahead of it before Eleanor buried us both. But he was too scared."

"So you came to Millbrook."

"I came because I heard Eleanor was dead. I came because Victor called me in tears at six in the morning, terrified that the police would find out about our arrangement. And I came—" She paused, her eyes meeting mine. "I came because I knew you were on the case. And I thought... maybe it was finally time to tell you the truth."

I stood up from the chair, needing to move, needing to process. The motel room felt too small suddenly, the walls pressing in.

"Our entire marriage." The words came out rough, accusatory. "You knew about Eleanor, about the Ashworths, about what she did to my grandmother. You knew, and you never told me."

"I didn't know about your grandmother." Sarah's voice was urgent, pleading. "Not at first. When we met, I knew you were a Marlowe, knew there was some connection to Millbrook's old families. But I didn't know the details. I didn't know about Marcus Webb, or the locket, or what Eleanor had done to your family." She moved toward me, stopping just out of reach. "I swear, James—when I married you, I thought the Ashworth connection was behind me. I thought I'd escaped."

"Then how did you find out?"

"Your grandmother's things." Sarah's voice dropped. "After she died, you asked me to help sort through her papers. Remember? All those boxes in the attic, the letters and photographs she'd kept for decades."

I remembered. Three years ago, before everything fell apart. My grandmother's funeral, the hollow grief, the sense that I'd lost something I'd never fully understood.

"The photograph," I said. "The one you framed for me."

"I found other things with it. Letters. A diary she'd kept during the years she worked for Eleanor. Notes about Marcus Webb, about the pregnancy, about what Eleanor had done to destroy her." Sarah's eyes were wet now. "I realized then that Eleanor hadn't just destroyed my life—she'd destroyed yours too. Your entire family, going back generations. And I wanted to tell you, James. I wanted to show you everything I'd found. But..."

"But you were still taking money from Victor."

"Yes." The word was barely a whisper. "If I told you the truth, you'd want to investigate. You'd pull the thread, and the whole thing would unravel, and Victor would expose me, and you'd find out about the blackmail..." She trailed off, shaking her head. "I was a coward. I chose to protect my secret rather than give you the truth you deserved."

"Is that why you left? Why you wanted the divorce?"

"I left because I couldn't keep lying to you." Sarah's voice cracked. "Every day, waking up next to you, knowing what I was hiding—it was destroying me. I thought... I thought if I left, if I disappeared again, you could move on. You could investigate your grandmother's death without me getting in the way. You could find the truth on your own terms."

"So you abandoned me to protect yourself."

"I abandoned you to protect you." Her eyes flashed. "If Eleanor had found out I was married to a Millbrook detective, if she'd discovered I was still connected to Victor, if she'd learned that your grandmother's grandson was investigating old family secrets..." Sarah shook her head. "Eleanor destroyed everyone who got too close to her crimes, James. I wasn't going to let her destroy you too."

I stood there in the weak morning light, looking at this woman who had been my wife, my partner, my companion through the hardest years of my career. I wanted to hate her. Part of me did hate her—for the lies, for the secrets, for the three years of silence that had eaten away at me like acid.

But another part of me understood. Eleanor Ashworth had been a monster. She'd crushed everyone who crossed her, destroyed lives and families with the casual cruelty of someone swatting flies. Sarah had done what she'd needed to survive.

That didn't make it right. But it made it understandable.

"Eleanor is dead now," I said finally. "Someone poisoned her before Julian Ashworth tried to strangle her. We're still looking for the poisoner."

Sarah went very still. "And you think I might be a suspect."

"You had motive. You were in town—you said you arrived yesterday. You knew the family, knew the house, knew Eleanor's routines."

"I arrived yesterday morning, James. Eleanor died the night before." Sarah's voice was steady. "Check the flight manifests. I was in Detroit when she was killed."

"I will." I pulled out my notebook, falling back on professional routine like a lifeline. "Where were you the night Eleanor died? Walk me through it."

"I was at my mother's care facility until nine. Then I went home, packed a bag, tried to sleep. Victor's call woke me at six-fifteen." Sarah sat back down on the bed, her posture deflating. "I took the first flight I could get—seven-forty-five out of Detroit Metro. I was in Millbrook by ten in the morning."

"Anyone who can verify your whereabouts that night?"

"The night staff at my mother's facility. My neighbor, maybe—I think she heard me come home." Sarah met my eyes. "I didn't kill Eleanor, James. God knows I wanted to, for twenty years I wanted to, but I didn't. When I heard she was dead, I felt—" She paused, searching for the word. "Relief. Grief. Anger that someone else had taken the revenge I'd fantasized about for so long."

"But not guilt."

"No. Not guilt." Her voice was firm. "Whatever else I've done, I'm not a murderer."

I closed my notebook and slipped it back into my pocket. The sunlight was shifting through the motel window now, throwing long shadows across the worn carpet.

"There's something else," Sarah said. "Something you need to know about Eleanor's death."

I waited.

"Victor called me the morning after. Hysterical, barely coherent. He kept saying that he hadn't meant for it to go this far, that he'd only wanted to scare her, that Diana had promised it would just make Eleanor sick—"

"Wait." The word came out sharp. "Diana?"

"He mentioned her name three times before he realized what he was saying. Then he hung up and hasn't answered my calls since." Sarah's eyes were wide, uncertain. "James, I think Diana might be involved. I think she might be the one who poisoned Eleanor."

I stood frozen, processing. Diana Ashworth. The elegant wife who had endured Eleanor's cruelty for years. The woman who had claimed she didn't care about her mother-in-law's opinion anymore—who had seemed almost bored during our interview.

Diana, who had access to Eleanor's food.

Diana, who had gone to bed early, claiming she'd taken a sleeping pill.

Diana, who had been quietly watching while everyone else in the family fell apart.

"Victor told you Diana was involved."

"He implied it. Maybe he was trying to deflect blame, maybe he was telling the truth—I don't know. But the way he said it..." Sarah shook her head. "It sounded like they'd planned something together. Like Diana had been the one with the idea, and Victor had just gone along with it."

I thought about the timeline. Victor confronting Eleanor at eleven-thirty, her already compromised by poison. Diana claiming she'd gone to bed at eleven, taken a pill, slept through everything. The convenient alibi of unconsciousness.

"Did Victor say anything else? Anything specific about what Diana did?"

"Just that she 'promised it would only make Eleanor sick.' That 'it wasn't supposed to kill her.'" Sarah's voice was careful, precise. "James, I know how this looks—me pointing the finger at someone else. But I'm telling you what Victor said. Make of it what you will."

I moved toward the door, my mind already racing ahead. If Diana had poisoned Eleanor—expecting only to make her ill, perhaps to incapacitate her—then the murder wasn't premeditated. It was manslaughter at best. But combined with Julian's strangulation attempt and Eleanor's self-inflicted wound...

Three people. Three separate attacks on the same woman in the same night. A poisoner, a strangler, and the victim herself, all converging in that library like actors in a tragedy none of them had scripted.

"James." Sarah's voice stopped me at the door. "I know you probably hate me right now. And I understand if you never want to see me again. But whatever happens next—I need you to know that I never stopped loving you. The marriage, the secrets, leaving—none of it was because I didn't love you."

I turned back to face her. In the harsh motel light, she looked older than her years. Tired. Worn down by decades of carrying secrets that had grown too heavy to bear.

"I don't hate you, Sarah." The words surprised me, but they were true. "I don't know what I feel. Angry, betrayed, confused—all of it at once. But I don't hate you."

"That's more than I deserve."

"Maybe. But it's the truth." I opened the door, letting the morning air wash over me. "I'll need you to come to the station later. Give a formal statement about your whereabouts, your history with Victor, everything you just told me."

"I'll be there."

I stepped outside, into the parking lot, into the daylight that felt too bright after the dimness of the motel room. Behind me, I heard Sarah say one more thing:

"Be careful with Diana, James. If she really did poison Eleanor... she's been hiding it perfectly. Which means she's better at deception than any of us realized."

I didn't respond. I got in my car and drove toward the Ashworth estate, toward the woman who might be the poisoner I'd been hunting for two days.

The morning was bright and clear. The kind of day that should have felt like a fresh start.

But I knew better now. Some truths don't set you free. They just show you how deep the darkness goes.

---

Reyes was waiting for me on the mansion's front steps, her phone pressed to her ear and her face tight with controlled urgency. She ended the call as I approached.

"We've got a problem."

"Add it to the list."

"Julian's lawyer is already here—showed up twenty minutes ago, some heavy hitter from Boston that the family keeps on retainer. He's not letting Julian say another word without a deal on the table." Reyes fell into step beside me as we walked toward the entrance. "And Victor has locked himself in his study. Says he's not talking to anyone without counsel present."

"What about Diana?"

Reyes paused, giving me a sharp look. "Diana's been cooperative. Almost too cooperative, actually. She's been offering coffee to the officers, asking if anyone needs anything, playing the gracious hostess." She tilted her head. "Why do you ask?"

"Because I have reason to believe she might be our poisoner."

I told her about Sarah's revelation—Victor's panicked phone call, his mention of Diana, the implication that the poison was meant to sicken rather than kill. Reyes listened without interruption, her expression growing increasingly grim.

"That's thin," she said when I finished. "Hearsay from your ex-wife about a panicked phone call. Diana's lawyer would tear it apart."

"I know. But it's a direction." I pushed through the front door. "Where is Diana now?"

"Conservatory. She's been there all morning, 'tending to the plants' according to the officers." Reyes's voice was dry. "Which is interesting, considering the conservatory is also where Eleanor kept her collection of rare botanicals."

We looked at each other. The same thought passing between us.

"Get forensics back here," I said. "Have them check every plant in that conservatory. If Diana used something from Eleanor's own collection to poison her—"

"—there might be evidence. Pruning marks, missing specimens, something that shows recent harvesting." Reyes was already pulling out her phone. "I'll make the call."

I headed for the conservatory alone.

The morning light poured through the glass walls, turning the space into a cathedral of green and gold. Plants of every description filled the room—ferns and orchids, tropical specimens and desert succulents, arranged with an artist's eye for color and form. At the far end, surrounded by what looked like medicinal herbs, Diana Ashworth stood with her back to me.

She was humming something. A melody I almost recognized.

"Mrs. Ashworth."

She turned, and her face was serene. Composed. The same careful mask she'd worn throughout every interview, every revelation, every moment of crisis in this house.

"Detective Marlowe." She set down the watering can she'd been holding. "I was wondering when you'd come to see me."

"You knew I would."

"I suspected." She gestured to a wrought-iron bench nearby. "Would you like to sit? I imagine we have quite a lot to discuss."

I didn't sit. I stood among Eleanor Ashworth's plants, watching the woman who might have killed her, and waited.

Diana's smile was small, knowing. "You've spoken to Sarah, haven't you? Victor's little secret from twenty years ago." She laughed softly. "I always knew about her, you know. From the beginning. Eleanor told me on my wedding day—wanted me to know exactly what kind of weak, faithless man I was marrying."

"And yet you stayed."

"And yet I stayed." Diana moved through the plants with practiced ease, her fingers brushing leaves and petals like old friends. "Do you know why, Detective? Because Eleanor underestimated me. She thought I was just another gold-digger, another opportunist looking for Ashworth money. She never imagined I might have my own plans."

"What plans?"

Diana stopped beside a cluster of delicate white flowers. Her fingers traced the petals with something like tenderness.

"Do you know what these are? Aconitum napellus. Monkshood. One of the most poisonous plants in the world." She smiled at me over her shoulder. "Eleanor grew them for their beauty. She never considered that someone might use them for their other properties."

My hand moved toward my weapon. "Diana—"

"Relax, Detective. I'm not going to hurt you." She turned to face me fully, and for the first time, I saw something real in her eyes. Something hard and bright and utterly unafraid. "I'm going to tell you exactly what I did. And then you're going to arrest me. And finally—finally—this nightmare will be over."

I didn't move. I didn't speak. I let her continue.

"I poisoned Eleanor's tea that night. Just a small amount—enough to make her sick, to cloud her mind, to give Victor and me time to search her office for the documents that would have destroyed us both." Diana's voice was matter-of-fact, clinical. "It wasn't supposed to kill her. I calculated the dosage carefully. She should have been incapacitated for a few hours, nothing more."

"But something went wrong."

"Everything went wrong." Diana's composure cracked, just slightly. "Victor was supposed to meet me in the library at midnight. We were going to find the evidence she'd gathered against us—the financial records, the proof of Victor's embezzlement, the files she kept on everyone in this family. We were going to destroy it all while she slept off the effects."

"But Julian got there first."

Diana nodded slowly. "I was in the hallway when I heard them. Julian's voice, Eleanor's weak responses. I hid in the alcove near the stairs and I watched—" Her voice broke. "I watched my own son put his hands around his grandmother's throat. I watched him try to kill her."

"Why didn't you stop him?"

"Because for one moment—one terrible, shameful moment—I wanted him to succeed." Tears streamed down Diana's face now, cutting tracks through her careful makeup. "I wanted Eleanor dead. I'd wanted it for twenty years. And watching Julian do what I'd been too cowardly to do myself... I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. I just stood there in the darkness and watched."

"But he stopped."

"He stopped. He ran. And I stood there, knowing Eleanor was dying from my poison, knowing my son had tried to strangle her, knowing everything was falling apart." Diana wiped at her eyes with shaking hands. "I should have called for help. I should have tried to save her. But I was too afraid. I went back to my room and I took a real sleeping pill and I told myself that whatever happened, I hadn't done enough to kill her."

"The medical examiner says she died from the letter opener wound. Self-inflicted."

Diana's laugh was bitter, broken. "So in the end, Eleanor killed herself. Even in death, she had to be in control." She looked at me with red-rimmed eyes. "Does it matter, Detective? I poisoned her. I watched my son try to murder her. I did nothing to save her. Whatever the official cause of death, I'm responsible."

I pulled out my handcuffs. "Diana Ashworth, you're under arrest for the attempted murder of Eleanor Ashworth. You have the right to remain silent..."

She held out her hands, accepting the cuffs with a dignity that seemed almost peaceful.

"Thank you," she whispered as I clicked them shut.

"For what?"

"For ending it." She met my eyes one last time. "I've been waiting for this for twenty years. The prison I'm going to can't possibly be worse than the one I've been living in."

I led her out of the conservatory, through Eleanor's empire of exotic plants, toward the officers waiting in the hallway. Behind us, the white flowers of the monkshood swayed gently in the morning light—beautiful and deadly, just like the woman who had raised them.

The poisoner was caught. The strangler had confessed. The victim had taken her own life.

But as I handed Diana off to the waiting officers, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still missing. Some piece of the puzzle that hadn't fallen into place.

Eleanor Ashworth had been murdered by her own family—a collective act of desperation and rage and grief. But underneath it all, beneath the poison and the strangulation and the final desperate act...

What had driven them all to this point? What single event had set everything in motion?

The answer, I suspected, was still waiting to be found. And I had a feeling Catherine Webb knew more than she'd told me.

The investigation wasn't over. It was just beginning a new chapter.
