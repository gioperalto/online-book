# Assumptions

## Story Foundation
- The story follows Detective James Marlowe, a 52-year-old homicide detective in the town of Millbrook
- The murder victim is Eleanor Ashworth, 73, the matriarch of the wealthy Ashworth family
- Eleanor was killed using three methods: poison (in her tea), strangulation, and stabbing (letter opener)
- The setting is the Ashworth estate, a Gothic mansion that has been in the family for four generations
- The Ashworth family fortune was built on shipping

## Key Characters Established
- **Detective James Marlowe**: First-person narrator, has a personal history with the Ashworth family, recognizes a locket found with Eleanor's body
- **Captain Maria Reyes**: Marlowe's superior, silver-streaked hair, 15-year working relationship with Marlowe
- **Victor Ashworth**: Eleanor's son, soft around the middle, sharp-eyed, married to Diana, resentful of his mother's control
- **Diana Ashworth**: Victor's wife, blonde, calculated beauty, despised by Eleanor as a "gold-digger," has a defensive demeanor
- **Margot Ashworth**: Eleanor's daughter, described as "fragile" but shows hidden steel, emotionally damaged by Eleanor who paid off her lover 20 years ago
- **Julian Ashworth**: Victor's son, law student, home for the weekend (mentioned but not yet interviewed)
- **Rosa Martinez**: Housekeeper who found the body at 3 a.m.
- **Thomas Chen**: Groundskeeper, lives in cottage on property (mentioned but not yet interviewed)
- **David Sterling**: Eleanor's personal attorney, stayed overnight to discuss "business" (likely the will) (mentioned but not yet interviewed)
- **Sarah**: Someone from Marlowe's past, he hasn't spoken to her in 3 years, he calls her about the case

## Mystery Elements
- The gold heart-shaped locket found in Eleanor's hand belonged to Marlowe's grandmother and disappeared 20 years ago
- Eleanor frequently changed her will, creating motive around inheritance
- Margot reveals Eleanor "destroyed" the original owner of the locket long ago
- Marlowe has a personal photograph he keeps face-down, suggesting unresolved emotional connection to this family
- The three methods of death suggest either extreme thoroughness by one killer or multiple killers acting independently
- Both Victor and Diana know something about the locket but claim ignorance

## Setting Details
- The story takes place in modern times (characters have smartphones)
- Millbrook is a town where the Ashworths have significant influence
- The Ashworth estate has a formal dining room, library, drawing room, conservatory, and multiple guest rooms
- The estate has a gated driveway where police can prevent residents from leaving

## Character Relationships and Tensions
- Eleanor controlled her family through money ("held the purse strings like a noose")
- Victor resented his mother but insists he had no motive since he would inherit naturally
- Diana endured Eleanor's disapproval for years before claiming not to care anymore
- Margot was emotionally destroyed by Eleanor's interference in her love life 20 years ago
- Marlowe has a complicated, personal history with the Ashworth family that spans at least 20+ years
- Sarah is someone important from Marlowe's past whom he needs to tell "things he should have told three years ago"

## Plot Threads for Future Development
- What happened to Marlowe's grandmother and her locket 20 years ago?
- What "business" did Eleanor discuss with David Sterling the night she died?
- What does the will say and who inherits?
- What is Marlowe's full history with the Ashworth family?
- Who is Sarah and what is her connection to Marlowe and/or the Ashworths?
- Why were three methods of death used - one very thorough killer or multiple killers?
- Julian, Rosa, Thomas Chen, and David Sterling still need to be interviewed
