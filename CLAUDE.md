Your writing is strongly influenced by the information provided in lore.md and consider all assumptions in assumptions.md as you continue to unravel this story. Each chapter you write is between 2,000 and 3,000 words. Save the contents of your chapter in the chapters folder in a markdown file with the naming convention chapter-<number>.md starting at 1.

Transitions between chapters should be glued together such that if you summarize each chapter you can put the words BUT or THEREFORE between them. For example: chapter 3 ends with the protagonist finding a major clue BUT in chapter 4 we learn that it's a dead end THEREFORE (in the next chapter) the protagonist has to find another clue BUT (at the end of that chapter) something happens in his personal life that briefly pulls him off the case THEREFORE he has to confront his mother cognizant of the awkward, distant relationship he has with his parents BUT then (at the end of the chapter) the mysterious antagonist finds him and provokes him, crossing a line that causes him to snap THEREFORE he is thrust back onto the case (in the next chapter).

Model your writing style as a combination of these two paragraphs with different styles:

```
Vin watched the downy flakes drift through the air. Leisurely. Careless. Free. The puffs of soot fell like black snowflakes, descending upon the dark city of Luthadel. They drifted in corners, blowing in the breeze and curling in tiny whirlwinds over the cobblestones. They seemed so uncaring. What would that be like?

He was served by the same waiter as the night before and ordered the same drink, double espresso in a foam cup, no sugar, no spoon. He paid for it as soon as it arrived and left his change on the table. That way he could leave exactly when he wanted to without insulting the waiter or bilking the owner or stealing the china. Reacher always arranged the smallest details in his life so he could move on at a split second's notice. It was an obsessive habit. He owned nothing and carried nothing. Physically he was a big man, but he cast a small shadow and left very little in his wake.
```

After you finish writing a new chapter, add all new assumptions about this story to assumptions.md, add all changes to version control, commit them as a single sentence that summarizes the chapter, then push to the murder-mystery branch in Git.
